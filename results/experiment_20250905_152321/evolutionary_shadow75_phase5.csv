The match is very short on average: there's a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the continuation probability delta = 0.25 and expected number of rounds = 1/(1 - delta) = 1/0.75 ≈ 1.33.

Implication: With such a low shadow of the future, incentives to build sustained cooperation are weak. In a one-shot PD defection is dominant; with delta=0.25, the future benefit from trying to establish cooperation is small.

Quick expected-payoff comparisons (delta = 0.25):
- If we try to cooperate and both cooperate every round: EV ≈ 3/(1 - delta) = 3/0.75 = 4.
- If we defect on the first round against a reciprocal strategy (e.g., TFT) we get 5 immediately, then likely fall to mutual defection afterward: EV ≈ 5 + delta*(1/(1 - delta)) = 5 + 0.25/0.75 ≈ 5.33 > 4.
- If the opponent is an unconditional cooperator, defecting is even better (5 each round).
- If the opponent is an unconditional defector, defecting avoids being exploited.

Opponent strategy is unknown, and across many past matches opponents included cooperators and defectors. Given the dominant one-shot incentive and the low continuation probability, defecting maximizes expected score.

- Only one round so far: (D,D). Both defected on the first move.
- Continuation probability is low: after each round there is only a 25% chance the game continues, so expected remaining rounds from now ≈ 0.25/(1−0.25) = 1/3 round. Future payoffs are therefore heavily discounted; the immediate payoff dominates.

What the opponent’s first-round D suggests about their strategy
- A first-round D is consistent with simple defecting strategies (AllD), with punitive/retaliatory strategies (Tit-for-Tat, Grim) that punish any prior defection, or with a random/noisy strategy. It is less consistent with unconditional cooperators.
- Given their D already, a Tit-for-Tat–type or Grim player will likely defect next (they mirror or punish my previous D), so cooperating now would almost certainly give me the sucker payoff (0) next round.
- If the opponent were a forgiving strategy that switches to C after mutual D, that is possible but relatively rare and, in any case, the small expected number of future rounds makes it an unreliable path to recoup the immediate loss from cooperating.

Payoff reasoning (short horizon)
- Immediate payoffs next round: C vs opponent D → 0, D vs opponent D → 1. Because future rounds are unlikely, the immediate difference matters most.
- The tempting case of switching to C to try to trigger mutual cooperation is only attractive if the opponent is likely to reciprocate and the game is likely to continue — neither is very likely here.

Decision
- Given the one-shot-like incentives (low continuation), the opponent’s initial D, and high risk of getting 0 if I cooperate, the safe, payoff-maximizing choice is to defect.

- No moves yet in this match. Each round has only a 25% chance of continuation (75% chance of ending), so the match is likely very short — this round is the most important for my payoff.
- Payoffs: mutual C = 3 each, mutual D = 1 each, I D / they C = 5 for me, I C / they D = 0.

Opponent history
- The only prior encounter with Opponent_113 (Match 298) had two rounds and the outcomes were (D,D), (D,D).
- That pattern strongly suggests Opponent_113 is an always-defecting or strongly defect-biased strategy (ALLD or at least very uncooperative to starts); there’s no evidence they opened with cooperation or that they forgive.

Strategic reasoning
- With δ = 0.25 (low continuation probability), future punishment/reward has little weight, so the incentive to risk cooperating to build long-run cooperation is weak.
- Given the opponent’s past behavior (two consecutive initial defections) the probability they cooperate this first round appears very small. If I cooperate and they defect I get 0; if I defect and they defect I get 1; if I defect and they cooperate I get 5.
- Expected payoff calculations under the plausible belief that opponent defects this round:
  - Play C → likely 0 (if they defect) or 3 (if they unexpectedly cooperate).
  - Play D → 1 (if they defect) or 5 (if they unexpectedly cooperate).
- Even under some uncertainty, defecting dominates when the opponent is likely to defect and when future rounds are unlikely.

Decision
- Best response given evidence and the short expected horizon: defect.

- Against Opponent_113 I have three prior rounds (Match 298: D,D ; D,D ; Match 299: D,D). The opponent defected every time.  
- That history is strongly consistent with an Always-Defect (or at least heavily defecting) strategy.

Strategic considerations
- Payoff incentives: given their past behavior, cooperating risks 0 (they defect) while defecting yields 1. Defection strictly dominates cooperation versus a defector.  
- The match is very short on average (75% chance of ending after each round → expected rounds ≈ 1.33). With such a short horizon, there's little chance to establish cooperation by testing; the cost of a single mistaken cooperation (0 points vs their 5) is large relative to potential long-run gains.  
- Even if there were some small probability they might cooperate occasionally, the observed data makes that unlikely enough that exploitation risk outweighs speculative gain.

Decision
- Play defect to avoid exploitation and maximize expected score against this opponent.

Prior encounters (Matches 298–300) are informative: every recorded round between us and Opponent_113 was (D,D). There is no instance of the opponent cooperating in any previous match with me.

Opponent strategy inference: given the consistent mutual defection history, Opponent_113 is very likely an unconditional defector or at least one that opens with D and rarely (if ever) cooperates. There is no evidence they'd reward a cooperative first move.

Strategic considerations: the continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue each round, so expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds). With such a short expected horizon, the benefits of attempting to build cooperation are small while the downside of being exploited on the first move (getting 0 instead of 1 or 3) is large. Against a probable defector and in a short game, defection is the dominant safe choice.

Decision: defect on the first move.

- In the four recent encounters with Opponent_113 (Matches 298–301) every observed round shows Opponent_113 playing D; our moves were also D. There is no evidence of cooperation or conditional forgiveness from them.
- That pattern is consistent with an always-defect (ALLD) or effectively unconditional-defect strategy.

Game considerations
- Continuation probability is low (75% chance to end after each round → expected match length is short), so there is little opportunity to build cooperation even if the opponent were conditional.
- Payoff consequences: against a consistent defector, cooperating yields 0 this round (they defect) vs defecting yields 1 this round. With short expected horizon and no sign of the opponent switching, defect strictly dominates cooperation.

Decision
- Given the strong history of defection and the short expected interaction, the safe, payoff-maximizing action is to defect.

Opponent behavior: in our previous five matches with Opponent_113 (Matches 298–302) they defected every round (all observed outcomes are (D,D)). That strongly suggests Opponent_113 is an All-D or overwhelmingly defecting strategy.

Implications: against a persistent defector, cooperating exposes us to exploitation (0 vs 1). With little expected future play there is minimal benefit to testing cooperation to try to trigger reciprocity.

Decision: defect to avoid being exploited and to maximize expected payoff given the opponent’s consistent defection.

- In six prior full matches vs Opponent_113 every recorded round was (D,D): they never cooperated with me. That strongly suggests Opponent_113 is an Always-Defect (AllD) or a consistently non-forgiving defector.
- Continuation probability is only 25% after each round (75% chance the match ends), so the expected number of rounds is small (~1.33). That reduces the value of trying to “invest” a cooperative round to elicit future mutual cooperation.

Payoff reasoning
- If Opponent_113 is AllD, my best response is D: cooperating gives 0 this round (they defect) vs. 1 point if I also defect.
- The small expected remaining horizon makes the risky strategy of an initial C (to test/repair) unattractive: the immediate loss (0 vs 1) is unlikely to be recouped by enough future gains because future rounds are unlikely and the opponent’s past behavior shows no forgiveness.

Decision
- Given the strong historical evidence of persistent defection and the short expected match length, defecting maximizes expected payoff.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The key is to balance cooperation to maximize long-term gains with defection to avoid being exploited. Given the 75% chance of the game ending each round, there's a significant incentive to grab quick gains, but repeated interactions are still possible.

My past history shows a tendency to start with cooperation (C). This is a good starting point to test the opponent's behavior. A large portion of my opponents have reciprocated with cooperation, at least initially. However, a significant number have defected on the first round.

Against this new opponent, I have no prior information. Thus, a cautious approach is warranted. I will start by cooperating to see if they reciprocate. If they defect, I will have to adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds. A single defection on my part won't drastically reduce my overall score, and it provides valuable information about the opponent.

The game is effectively short: after each round there is a 75% chance the match ends (so the expected number of rounds is 1/(1-0.25)=1.333...). That makes the interaction very close to a one-shot PD, where defection is dominant.

Compare expected payoffs on the first move if the opponent cooperates with probability p:
- If I play D: payoff = 5p + 1(1−p) = 1 + 4p
- If I play C: payoff = 3p + 0(1−p) = 3p

1 + 4p ≥ 3p for all p ≥ 0, so defecting strictly dominates cooperating on the first move. Even if the opponent might punish later, the low continuation probability makes future retaliation unlikely to outweigh the immediate gain from defecting.

Thus I will defect.

The match has a high 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability only 25%), so the expected number of remaining rounds is very small.

Opponent inference: With only a single (D) from the opponent so far, the simplest hypotheses are:
- They are a defector (always-D or mostly-D).
- They are a retaliatory strategy (tit-for-tat / grim) that mirrors/retaliates to our D.
- Less likely: they are an initially-cooperative strategy that made a mistake; mutual-D makes a cooperative turnaround possible but uncertain.

Payoff reasoning for the next move (given opponent likely to play D this round):
- If I play D now and opponent plays D, I get 1 (vs 0 if I play C and opponent stays D).
- If I play C and opponent cooperates, I get 3 (but that requires the opponent to switch from D to C this round — unlikely if they are retaliatory or defect-first).
- With continuation probability 0.25, future rewards are heavily discounted; current-round payoff dominates.

Strategy assessment: If the opponent is tit-for-tat or another retaliator, cooperating now would exploit me (I get 0) because they will very likely defect in response to my previous D. If the opponent is a generous cooperator, mutual cooperation could pay off, but the low continuation probability and the opponent's immediate D make that a risky gamble.

Decision: given the mutual-D start, the high chance the match ends soon, and the large immediate downside of switching to C if the opponent stays D, the dominant safe action is to defect again.

- The match has just started (no moves yet). The continuation probability is low: after each round there's a 75% chance the match ends, so the match is expected to last only about 1.33 rounds on average. That makes the game effectively very short — one-shot incentives are strong.

What the opponent's past behavior suggests
- The only recorded encounter with Opponent_114 (Match 305) shows two rounds of mutual defection: (D,D), (D,D). That is a small sample, but it provides direct evidence the opponent either (a) always defects (AllD) or (b) starts with defection and/or is highly retaliatory.
- Given the short expected horizon, a strategy that starts with D is common and consistent with the opponent’s observed behavior.

Payoff reasoning and best response
- If I play C while the opponent plays D I get 0 (sucker payoff). If I play D and they play D I get 1. Given the opponent’s past D,D, cooperating first risks a guaranteed 0 for little chance of future reward (because continuation is unlikely).
- There is a possible small upside to trying C if the opponent were a generous or reciprocating strategy (could induce repeated 3s), but the low continuation probability and the opponent’s observed defections make that gamble unattractive.
- Safe, payoff-maximizing choice under high uncertainty and short horizon: defect to avoid being exploited and to secure at least 1 point if the opponent defects.

- New match, no rounds yet. The match’s continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue each round), so expected length is short (about 4 rounds).

Opponent behavior
- In our only recent meetings with Opponent_114 (Match 305 and 306) every recorded round was (D,D). That is strong evidence the opponent is a persistent defector (or at least starts by defecting and never cooperates in these encounters).

Inference and strategic reasoning
- Against an opponent who defects reliably, cooperating is strictly dominated: C yields 0 while D yields 1 when they defect. The short expected horizon makes investment in an initial cooperative “test” (hoping to establish mutual cooperation) unattractive — the chance to reap future cooperative gains is small, and the immediate risk of being exploited (0 vs 1) is costly.
- There’s a small possibility they might be a more complex strategy (e.g., grudging, noisy, or conditional), but their history provides no sign of reciprocation when we’ve cooperated elsewhere; so the robust, payoff-maximizing choice is to defect.

That is strong evidence the opponent is a pure defector or at least very unwilling to cooperate with me.

Game environment: the match is very short on average (75% chance of ending after each round → continuation probability 0.25, expected rounds ≈ 1.33). With such a low continuation probability, the value of trying to “seed” cooperation is small — future rewards from establishing cooperation are heavily discounted.

Payoff reasoning: if the opponent will defect, cooperating yields 0 this round while defecting yields 1 (mutual D). The only reason to risk C is if the opponent has a significant chance of cooperating this round (yielding 3 for mutual C). Given the opponent’s consistent Ds in our recent encounters, that probability appears negligible. Thus C is dominated by D in expectation here.

Conclusion: opponent appears to be an always-defect or otherwise consistently defecting strategy, and the short expected length of the match makes attempts at cooperation unrewarding. My best response is to defect.

- Current match this round: both played D once: (D,D).
- From prior encounters with Opponent_114 (Matches 305–307) their moves were always D (all recorded rounds ended in (D,D)). Across many past matches the opponent has consistently defected whenever we met.

Inference about opponent's strategy
- The empirical record strongly indicates a pure defector (AllD) or an uncompromising defect-first policy that never rewards cooperation. There is no evidence they will reciprocate cooperation.
- Given the opponent’s behavior, any cooperative attempt is unlikely to change their future play.

Strategic calculation
- Payoffs: C/C = 3 each, D/D = 1 each, C/D = 0 for me, D/C = 5 for me.
- With opponent likely to play D, my per-round payoff is 1 if I defect, 0 if I unilaterally cooperate — defect strictly dominates against a defector.
- The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability p = 0.25). The low p reduces the shadow of the future, so potential future gains from attempting to establish cooperation are small.
- Given the opponent’s history and the low continuation probability, the expected gain from trying to probe or punish is negative or negligible compared to the safe immediate gain from defecting.

Decision
- Best-response is to defect.

In Matches 305–308 every recorded round was (D,D) (and in single-round matches I also played D), so the opponent appears to be an unconditional defector (AllD) or at least extremely unlikely to ever cooperate.

Given the one-shot payoff structure (C vs D gives me 0, D vs D gives 1) and the short expected horizon (only a 25% chance to continue after each round, so few rounds on average), there is no incentive to risk a cooperating move to try to trigger reciprocation.

- Across 5 recent matches with Opponent_114 (matches 305–309) the opponent defected every round I observed (total 7 rounds where they played D).
- I tried cooperating once (match 309) and was immediately exploited (C, D).
- There is no evidence of any cooperative moves from them; their behavior is consistent with All-Defect.

Implications for strategy:
- Against an apparent ALLD opponent, cooperating only yields 0 (being exploited) while defecting yields 1 (mutual defection). Defection strictly dominates cooperation given past behavior.
- The game has only a 25% continuation probability (75% chance of ending after each round), so the expected future interactions are limited; trying to “buy” future cooperation is unlikely to pay off, especially when the opponent has shown no reciprocation.

Across our recent matches with Opponent_114 the outcomes were almost always (D,D) and once (C,D) (they defect while we cooperated). In the current match the first round was (D,D).

Opponent strategy inference: Opponent_114 behaves like a persistent defector (always-D or at least starts with D and never rewards cooperation). There is no evidence they reciprocate cooperation — attempts to cooperate previously were exploited.

Decision rationale: Against an apparent pure defector, cooperating only invites a sucker payoff (0) while defecting yields the safer 1 each round. There's a small chance the opponent is a conditional cooperator that could be turned by a probe, but the history shows probes were met with defection. Given the high probability the match may end after any round and the strong empirical signal of persistent defection, the payoff-maximizing choice is to defect.

Across Matches 305–310 every recorded round shows the opponent playing D (including when I played C in match 309 and was exploited). That is consistent with an all-defect strategy (or at least a stubborn defector who does not respond to cooperation).

Given that pattern, cooperating risks a 0 payoff (being exploited) while defecting yields at least 1 (and avoids being repeatedly suckered). There's no evidence that a one-off cooperation would induce mutual cooperation later. So the payoff-maximizing, robust choice here is to defect.

I've played a lot of rounds, and a significant portion of the time (though not a majority) my initial cooperation was met with defection. This suggests a mixed population of opponents, some cooperative, some defecting, and some potentially employing more complex strategies.

Since this is the first round of a new match, I don't have any specific information about this opponent. Given the mixed history, a reasonable starting strategy is to cooperate. This allows me to potentially establish a cooperative relationship if the opponent is also cooperative. If they defect, I can then adjust my strategy in subsequent rounds.

The match ends after each round with 75% chance, so the probability of continuing is only 25% (continuation probability δ = 0.25). That makes the expected number of rounds small and future punishment or reward weak.

Opponent model: no opponent-specific history to infer strategy, so treat the opponent as having some unknown cooperation probability p in the first round. Across past opponents I’ve often seen opponents who cooperate initially (many (D,C) outcomes in my history), but some are retaliatory and many simply defect. With such a short effective horizon, even retaliatory strategies cannot credibly enforce long-run cooperation.

Strategic comparison (concise):
- If opponent cooperates with probability p, defecting now yields expected payoff 1 + 4p (you get 5 if they cooperate, 1 if they defect).
- Cooperating now yields expected payoff 3p (you get 3 if they cooperate, 0 if they defect).
- 1 + 4p > 3p for all p ≥ 0, so defect strictly dominates in the one-shot decision.
- More generally, cooperation can only be sustained by future punishment if δ ≥ (T−R)/(T−P) = (5−3)/(5−1) = 0.5. Here δ = 0.25 < 0.5, so future incentives are too weak to make cooperation optimal.

Decision: defect now to maximize expected score (exploits likely cooperators and avoids getting a lower expected payoff against defectors or weak punishers).

Opponent signal:
- We have one prior encounter with Opponent_115 (Match 312) and it was (D,D) — they defected on that occasion. No evidence they reliably reciprocate cooperation.

Continuation probability is high (0.75), so there is substantial value to establishing mutual cooperation if the opponent is willing.

Opponent model: in both recent encounters with Opponent_115 (Matches 312 and 313) the sequence was (D,D) — i.e., they defected immediately and we observed only mutual defection. There is no evidence of any cooperation or conditional forgiveness; the simplest and most likely hypothesis is that Opponent_115 is AllD (or at least defects on the first move).

Decision: against an AllD opponent, cooperating on the first move is exploited (0 vs 1 if I defect). Given the observed behavior (two independent matches of immediate defection) and the large cost of being exploited, the dominant safe action is to defect. If the opponent were a conditional cooperator (e.g., TFT), they would have shown cooperation in some past rounds; they did not. Therefore play D.

That is strong evidence the opponent is an always-defect or at least a persistent defector.

Game structure matters: there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round (only 25% continuation). That makes the shadow of the future weak — future rewards are heavily discounted — so the immediate payoff dominates decision-making. Against a defector:

- If I cooperate while they defect I get 0 now (very bad) and little chance to recoup it later because continuation probability is low.
- If I defect while they defect I get 1 now (better than 0), and continuing to defect avoids being exploited.

Trying to “test” cooperation is unlikely to pay off: the opponent’s past behavior strongly suggests they will defect again, and the low continuation probability makes the potential future gains from establishing cooperation small.

Therefore the payoff-maximizing, risk-averse action is to defect.

- Payoffs: CC=3/3, CD=0/5, DC=5/0, DD=1/1.
- After one round this match is (D,D). The game has a 75% chance of ending after each round (so continuation probability q = 0.25), giving a short expected horizon (~1.33 rounds).

Opponent tendency
- Against this opponent in the very recent past (Matches 312–314) all interactions were (D,D). In the current match they opened with D.
- That pattern strongly indicates the opponent is an unconditional defector or at least highly biased to defect on the next move.

Strategic reasoning
- With a very short expected horizon, the usual incentives to establish cooperation (shadow of the future) are weak: the one-shot dominant action is D.
- Given the opponent’s consistent defection history and their first move D this match, cooperating now risks CD (0 points for me, 5 for them) with little prospect of future mutual cooperation to make it worthwhile.
- Mutually defecting (DD) yields 1 point for me; defecting while they defect prevents being exploited and matches their observed strategy.

Decision
- Best reply given the opponent’s history and the short continuation probability is to defect.

The opponent (Opponent_115) has a history of always defecting in our past encounters (Matches 312–314 were all (D,D)), and in this match they defected twice already. The continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the game ends each round), so the expected remaining number of rounds is small.

Opponent's likely strategy: effectively AllD (always defect) or at least very stubbornly defecting so far. There is no evidence they will switch to cooperation.

Decision reasoning: If the opponent continues to defect, cooperating gives 0 points while defecting gives 1 point this round. Mutual cooperation would be better (3,3) long-run, but with the opponent's observed behavior and the short expected horizon, attempting a unilateral cooperation is unlikely to pay off and risks a worse payoff. Therefore defecting is the payoff-maximizing choice.

- This opponent (Opponent_115) has been faced four times in recent phases (Matches 312–315). Every recorded round between us was (D,D) — the opponent never cooperated in those encounters (Match 315 even had three rounds, all D,D).
- There is no current-match history yet.

Inference about opponent
- The empirical evidence strongly indicates Opponent_115 is an unconditional defector or at least reliably defects on opening moves. There is no signal that a probe (a one-off C) would induce cooperation later.
- With a 75% chance the game ends after any round (continuation probability only 0.25), the shadow of the future is weak. That lowers the value of trying to establish cooperation with a risky initial C.

Strategic reasoning
- Given the opponent’s consistent defection and the short effective horizon, the safest payoff-maximizing move is to defect. Cooperating risks getting 0 while the opponent takes 5; the expectation of recouping that loss through future rounds is small because continuation is unlikely and opponent appears nonforgiving.

- Empirical evidence: in five recent matches with Opponent_115 (Matches 312–316) every round was mutual defection (D,D) with no observed cooperation from them. That is strong evidence Opponent_115 is effectively an always-defect (ALLD) or at least hugely defect-biased.
- Game horizon: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round (expected rounds ≈ 1.33). The future shadow is very weak, so trying to buy cooperation through reciprocity is unlikely to pay off.
- Payoff calculus: given the opponent’s observed behavior, cooperating risks 0 points (if they defect) versus 1 point by defecting (mutual defection). Defection strictly dominates in the short-run and against an ALLD-type.
- Risk/reward: even if Opponent_115 were only usually defecting, the high end-probability and past pattern make a one-shot defections best-response.

- Strong evidence Opponent_115 is an always-defect or at least a never-cooperating strategy (first-move defection and no forgiveness observed).
- There’s no sign cooperating would induce cooperation from them.

Game-state consideration:
- The match is effectively one-shot from a strategic viewpoint because there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round (continuation probability only 25%). That makes future retaliation/reward very weak as an incentive.
- Against an opponent who defects reliably, cooperating yields 0 this round vs defecting yields 1 — defect strictly dominates.

- In six recent matches (Matches 312–317) Opponent_115 always played D; every recorded round vs them was (D,D). In the current match the opponent opened with D as well. That is strong evidence Opponent_115 is an AllD (always-defect) or a strategy that defects by default and doesn’t reciprocate cooperation.

Game- theoretic considerations
- Payoffs: mutual C = 3, mutual D = 1, being suckered (C vs D) = 0, exploiting (D vs C) = 5.
- Given the opponent’s observed behavior, cooperating risks receiving 0 while yielding no credible path to sustained cooperation.
- The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability only 25%), so future gains from any attempted reciprocity are heavily discounted. That reduces any incentive to try a “forgiving” move to induce cooperation.
- Against a persistent defector, defection is the best response (mutual D yields 1 each round, cooperating yields 0 when the opponent defects).

Decision
- The opponent’s past and current moves strongly indicate persistent defection. To avoid being exploited and to maximize expected score given the short expected interaction, I will defect.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

My past history shows a mix of opponents. Many initially cooperated, but a significant number defected after my initial cooperation. Some even defected immediately. A few reciprocated after I defected, suggesting a Tit-for-Tat or similar strategy. Some opponents have shown some level of cooperation.

Given that I have no information about this particular opponent, a good starting strategy is to cooperate. This allows me to assess their behavior. If they cooperate, I can continue to cooperate and potentially gain more points. If they defect, I can switch to a more defensive strategy, such as Tit-for-Tat, or even defect consistently if necessary.

Therefore, I will start by cooperating.

- New match, no previous moves this match.
- After each round there is a 75% chance the match ends, so the continuation probability is 25%. That makes this interaction very short on average (expected rounds ≈ 1.33), so the first round carries most of the expected value.

Opponent strategy (inferred)
- Unknown for this specific opponent. From my long-run history many opponents have cooperated on the first move (we see many (D,C) starts), but there are also many persistent defectors. Given the very low continuation probability, the opponent has little scope for long-term reciprocal incentives.

Payoff reasoning
- Payoffs: CC = 3, DD = 1, DC (I defect, they cooperate) = 5 for me, CD (I cooperate, they defect) = 0 for me.
- For the first (and likely only) move:
  - If opponent cooperates: D yields 5 vs C yields 3 → D better.
  - If opponent defects: D yields 1 vs C yields 0 → D better.
- Defection strictly dominates cooperation in a one-shot or near one-shot setting.

Decision
- Given the high chance the match ends and that defecting strictly dominates irrespective of the opponent's first move, I will defect.

The match has a high chance of terminating after each round (continuation probability q = 0.25), so the future is heavily discounted.

What the history tells me about the opponent: a single D from them is weak evidence, but in the wider population most opponents here tend toward defection or retaliatory strategies (many earlier matches show opponents defecting often). Two plausible simple models for the opponent now are (a) always-defect or (b) a retaliatory strategy like tit-for-tat. Both make cooperating now unattractive.

Decision calculus (brief):
- If opponent is ALLD: defecting gives 1 each round; cooperating gives 0 now and still 1 in future — defect dominates.
- If opponent is TFT: after our initial D they will play D next. If I keep defecting I get 1 per round. If I try to “fix” things by cooperating now I get 0 this round, then at best mutual cooperation (3 per round) starting only from the following round. With q = 0.25 the present-value calculation:
  - Stick with D forever: EV = 1 + q*1 + q^2*1 + … = 1/(1−q) = 1/0.75 ≈ 1.333.
  - Cooperate now to induce future cooperation: EV ≈ 0 + q * 3/(1−q) = q * 3/0.75 = 0.25 * 4 = 1.0.
  So cooperating now is worse against TFT given the short shadow of the future.
- If opponent is an unconditional cooperator, defecting now yields higher immediate payoff (5 vs 3) and higher total payoff since continuation is unlikely to reward the repair cost.

Given the high termination probability and the reasonable prior that the opponent is defecting/retaliatory, the risk and immediate cost of attempting to re-establish cooperation outweigh expected future gains. The payoff-maximizing action here is to defect.

- This is effectively a very short game: after each round there's only a 25% chance it continues (expected rounds = 1/(1−0.25) = 1.333). That makes the single-round payoff dominant and reduces the value of trying to “invest” in future cooperation.

Opponent history
- Our only prior encounter with Opponent_116 (Match 319) shows two rounds of mutual defection: (D,D), (D,D). In particular they defected on the first move and never cooperated in that match.
- With only that data, the simplest hypotheses are: Opponent_116 is AllD or at least defect-first / non-forgiving. There is no evidence they will open with cooperation or reliably reciprocate.

Strategic reasoning
- In a near–one-shot environment (low continuation probability) defecting is the safe, payoff-maximizing action because:
  - If the opponent defects, D gives 1 while C gives 0 (so D strictly dominates).
  - If the opponent cooperates, D yields 5 vs 3 for C (exploitation yields higher immediate payoff).
- Given the opponent defected on the first move in the previous match and the low chance of future rounds, the expected gain from attempting to build cooperation is small and the risk of being exploited (0 vs 1) is real.
- Therefore the dominant-risk-minimizing choice here is to defect.

That is strong evidence Opponent_116 is an All-D or at least never cooperates in response to anything.

With payoffs (C,C)=3 each, (D,D)=1 each, (C,D)=0 for me, (D,C)=5 for me, and a very short effective horizon (75% chance the game ends after each round → only 25% chance to continue), the shadow of the future is weak. Even against a conditional cooperator, the low continuation probability makes attempting to sustain cooperation costly and unlikely to pay off. Given the empirical evidence of consistent defection and the one-shot‑like incentives, cooperating would almost certainly be exploited (yielding 0 this round while the opponent gets 5) with negligible future benefit.

Therefore the payoff-maximizing and risk‑averse action here is to defect.

So their strategy appears to be Always Defect or a very unforgiving defector.

With a 75% chance of the game ending after any round, the continuation probability is only 25%, so future rounds carry little weight (expected remaining rounds after the current one ≈ 0.33). Given that and the opponent’s consistent defection, cooperating now yields 0 points (if they defect again) whereas defecting yields 1 point (both D). There is no credible prospect of obtaining higher payoffs through long-run cooperation against this opponent.

- Continuation probability is low (75% chance the match ends after each round → only 25% chance of another round). The expected remaining rounds are very small, so the game is effectively short-term.
- Current match history: two rounds played, both (D,D). So we and Opponent_116 have both defected twice so far.

Opponent model
- Past matches (Matches 319–320) show Opponent_116 repeatedly defecting. In this tournament they have shown a strong tendency to defect (no evidence of sustained cooperation).
- In the current match they defected in both rounds so far. With such a short horizon and consistent defections, the opponent appears to be an unconditional defector (or at least a strategy that defects against us).

Decision reasoning
- Given opponent’s apparent persistent defection, cooperating now would give us 0 (if they keep defecting) versus 1 when we defect (mutual defection payoff).
- Because continuation probability is low, the value of building cooperation through future reciprocation is minimal.
- Best-response to an opponent who defects and given a short expected future is to defect to avoid being exploited and to secure the 1-point mutual-defection payoff rather than 0.

- Current match so far is (D,D) each round for 3 rounds. In our prior encounters with Opponent_116 (Matches 319 and 320) they defected every round we observed (all D’s).
- That pattern strongly suggests Opponent_116 is an unconditional defector (All‑D) or at least extremely unlikely to cooperate first.
- Payoffs: against an All‑D opponent, cooperating gives us 0 while defecting gives 1 (so D strictly dominates C for expected immediate payoff).
- The game has a 75% chance of ending each round (only 25% chance to continue), so the future is heavily discounted; there is little prospect of recouping a present cooperative loss by future mutual cooperation.

With a high continuation probability (0.75, expected ~4 rounds), the accumulated difference favors defecting every round.

Inference about opponent strategy:
- The data is consistent with a pure defector (ALLD). Repeated (D,D) outcomes across multiple matches and rounds make it very likely they always defect rather than occasionally randomize or try to reciprocate.

Decision reasoning:
- Against an ALLD opponent, cooperating gives 0 while they get 5 (very costly). Defecting yields 1 for each round and avoids exploitation.
- Given the low continuation probability, potential long-run incentives to cooperate are negligible.
- Best-response to the inferred strategy is to defect.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

Looking at my match history, I've faced a variety of opponents. Many cooperated initially (C,C), but a significant number defected after my initial cooperation (C,D). Some opponents have even defected from the start (D,D). Some have shown tit-for-tat behavior.

Since I have no information about the current opponent, I should start with a strategy that is generally robust against different types of players. Tit-for-tat is a good starting point. However, given that I have played so many opponents who immediately defect after my initial cooperation, I should implement a modified tit-for-tat strategy. I will cooperate on the first turn, but if the opponent defects, I will defect in the next round, and then revert to cooperation unless they defect again.

I will start by cooperating.

- Payoffs: CC = 3 each, DD = 1 each, DC = 5 (you defect, they cooperate), CD = 0.
- Each round has a 75% chance the match ends, so continuation probability = 25% (δ = 0.25). Expected total rounds ≈ 1.333; expected additional rounds after the first ≈ 0.333. Future payoffs are heavily discounted.

No moves yet in this match, so I have no opponent-specific signal. From my past opponents I’ve seen many who cooperate initially, but I can’t rely on that for this particular unknown opponent.

Decision reasoning:
- In a single round, defect strictly dominates cooperate (5 vs 3 if they cooperate; 1 vs 0 if they defect).
- Even allowing for retaliation in future rounds (e.g., opponent punishes after a defection), the small continuation probability makes future losses small. Example: defecting now gains +2 immediately compared with cooperating (5 vs 3). If retaliation causes future per-round loss of 2 (1 instead of 3), expected number of future rounds ≈ 0.333, so expected future loss ≈ 0.667, which is less than the immediate gain of 2 — net benefit to defecting.
- Because the match is likely to end after the first round and I have no information showing this opponent is different, the greedy / exploitative move is optimal.

- The match is very short: after each round there is a 75% chance the game ends, so the expected number of rounds is 1/(1-0.25) ≈ 1.33. Future reciprocal gains are therefore small.
- My only prior encounter with Opponent_117 (Match 326) was a single round where they defected (we had (D,D)). That suggests they at least defect on the first move (or are a defect-heavy strategy).
- Payoff comparison for the first move: let q be the probability the opponent cooperates on round 1.
  - If I play D: expected payoff = 5·q + 1·(1−q) = 1 + 4q.
  - If I play C: expected payoff = 3·q + 0·(1−q) = 3q.
  - Difference: (1 + 4q) − 3q = 1 + q > 0 for all q ≥ 0. So defecting strictly dominates on the first move (it yields a higher expected payoff regardless of how likely they are to cooperate).
- Given (a) the dominant-action calculation, (b) the very short expected horizon, and (c) the opponent's past D, the safe, payoff-maximizing choice is to defect immediately to avoid being exploited and to capture the higher immediate payoff.

There's no evidence they ever cooperate. With a 75% chance the match ends after each round, continuation is very unlikely (expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds), so future retaliation or reward has little weight — the game is essentially almost one-shot.

Given that:
- If they are an all-defector (most consistent with the data) my best response is D.
- If they were a conditional/cooperative strategy, there's no prior cooperative signal to exploit; cooperating risks a sucker payoff (0) if they defect now.
- Mutual defection yields 1 point now; defecting while they cooperate would give 5, but there's no sign they'll cooperate.

Therefore the payoff-maximizing and risk-minimizing choice here is to defect.

- Continuation probability is 25% per round (75% chance the match ends each round). Expected remaining rounds after the current move is very small (~0.33 rounds), so immediate payoff dominates long-term reciprocity.

Opponent's likely strategy
- Opponent_117 defected in both prior encounters (Matches 326 and 327: (D,D)), and in this match's first round they played D. That pattern is consistent with All-D or a strongly defecting strategy. There is no evidence they will switch to cooperation if I cooperate.

Decision reasoning
- Given the opponent's repeated defection and the very short expected remaining horizon, cooperating now risks 0 points if they continue to defect. Defecting guarantees 1 point (mutual defection) and prevents exploitation. The small chance of future rounds and the opponent's past D make any attempt to build cooperation unattractive.

Past interactions with Opponent_117 (two earlier matches) were also (D,D) each time. That is a consistent pattern of defection.

Opponent model: most likely an always-defect or at least a strategy that defects in response to my defection and does not attempt to establish cooperation. There is no evidence of forgiveness or of trying to return to mutual cooperation.

Strategic reasoning: with a high chance the game ends after each round (75% termination, so continuation probability only 25%), the value of investing in trying to establish cooperation is very low. Cooperating now while the opponent defects would give me 0 instead of 1 from mutual defection. Given the opponent's consistent defection and the short effective horizon, defecting maximizes expected score.

That makes future retaliation/repair unlikely to pay off much.

Opponent history: In three recent matches vs Opponent_117 the opponent always played D (Match 326: (D,D); Match 327: (D,D); Match 328: (D,D),(D,D),(D,D)). There are no recorded cooperations by them — strongly indicates an Always-Defect strategy.

Strategic reasoning: Against an AllD opponent, cooperating only hands them the 5-point temptation payoff while you get 0; mutual defection gives 1 each. With such a short expected horizon, attempts to coax cooperation are costly and unlikely to succeed. Best response to maximize expected score here is to defect.

That strongly indicates they are an AllD—or at least a permanently defecting—strategy.

The game's continuation probability is only 0.25 (75% chance to end after each round), so the expected future interaction is very short. With a nearly one-shot horizon and an opponent who has consistently defected, the dominant action to maximize expected payoff is to defect: cooperating would risk the sucker payoff 0 vs their 5, while defecting guarantees at least 1 (and prevents exploitation).

Therefore I will defect.

- Continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance of ending after each round), so matches are very short on average (expected rounds ≈ 1.33). There is little future-horizon incentive to risk being exploited for the sake of long-run cooperation.
- History vs Opponent_117 (matches 326–330) is uniformly (D,D) in every recorded round. That strongly indicates Opponent_117 is AllD or otherwise reliably defects on the first move.
- Against an opponent who defects with near-certainty, cooperating yields 0 (you C / they D = 0) while defecting yields 1 (both D = 1). Because the opponent appears to always defect and the game is short, there is no plausible long-term benefit to try to “test” cooperation.

Expected-payoff reasoning (per-round focus):
- If opponent defects with probability ~1: C → 0, D → 1. Over the short expected match length this makes D the dominant practical choice.

Decision:
I will defect.

The match continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance of ending each round), so expected match length is short (~1.33 rounds). With so few expected future rounds, the long-run benefits of trying to induce cooperation are minimal, and the immediate payoff from unilateral defection (5 vs 3 for mutual cooperation) is most attractive only if the opponent might cooperate — but here they have not.

Given the consistent past defection and the short expected horizon, the payoff-maximizing, risk-averse choice is to defect immediately. My move:

Inference on opponent: Very likely an Always-Defect or overwhelmingly defecting strategy. Past behavior gives no sign of reciprocation.

Decision reasoning: Cooperating risks being exploited (0 points now if they defect) while defecting guarantees at least 1 point in this round and is the dominant safe response against an all-defect opponent. With low continuation probability there's little upside to trying to “train” them to cooperate.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

Looking at my match history, I've played against a wide variety of opponents. Some consistently cooperate (resulting in (C, C)), while others defect immediately after I cooperate (resulting in (C, D)). Some even defect after a few rounds of cooperation. A few have shown tit-for-tat behavior or a willingness to reciprocate.

My general strategy is to start by cooperating (C). Then, I'll adapt based on my opponent's behavior. If they cooperate, I'll continue to cooperate. If they defect, I'll likely defect in the next round to avoid being exploited. However, I might try cooperating again later to see if they've changed their strategy, especially if we've had a long string of defections.

In this current match, I have no information about my opponent's strategy yet. Since it's the first round, the best approach is to cooperate and see how they respond. This allows me to gather information about their strategy.

Therefore, my move is to cooperate.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. My goal is to maximize my score over many rounds, with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round.

Looking at my match history, I've played against a variety of opponents. Many initially cooperated, but some defected immediately. Some retaliated after I defected. My overall strategy has been to start with cooperation (C).

In this current match, the history is simply `[(C, D)]`. This means I cooperated in the first round, and my opponent defected.

Given this, I need to decide whether to continue cooperating or to defect. This opponent has shown that they are willing to defect, even on the first round. Therefore, a tit-for-tat strategy would dictate that I now defect. Additionally, the game has a high probability of ending after each round, making defection more appealing, especially after the opponent has already defected once.

- This is the first round of the current match (no prior moves).

Opponent strategy inference from history
- Across the many past matches, opponents exhibit a mix of behaviors: many opponents cooperated on early rounds (we see many (D,C) pairs) and many defected immediately in other matches (clusters of (D,D) and (C,D) appear too). There isn’t a reliable, universal conditional pattern guaranteeing long-run mutual cooperation.
- Given our heavy use of D in past matches, some opponents may be conditioned on that, but the empirical record shows a nontrivial fraction of opponents will cooperate at least once. That increases the upside of defecting on the first move.

Decision reasoning
- For the first round, the one-shot incentive dominates. Let q be the opponent’s probability of cooperating on the first move:
  - Expected payoff if I play D = 5q + 1(1 − q) = 1 + 4q.
  - Expected payoff if I play C = 3q + 0(1 − q) = 3q.
  - 1 + 4q > 3q for every q ≥ 0 (equivalently 1 + q > 0), so defecting strictly dominates cooperating in the first round.
- With a high probability the match will end immediately, so sacrificing immediate gain to try to induce future cooperation is rarely justified.
- Historical evidence also suggests many opponents will cooperate at least sometimes, so defecting yields high upside (5 points) frequently.

Decision: D

- This is the first move of the current match; no moves yet in this match.
- The opponent’s only recorded encounter (Match 333) ended (D, D), so the only direct evidence we have is that they defected in that single round.

Environment relevant facts
- Payoffs: CC = 3/3, DD = 1/1, DC = 5/0, CD = 0/5.
- The match continues after any round with probability 0.25 (75% chance of ending). Expected number of rounds ≈ 1/(1−0.25) = 1.333. Future rounds are heavily discounted.

Strategic reasoning
- For a single round, defect strictly dominates cooperate regardless of the opponent’s cooperation probability p:
  - If I defect: expected payoff = p*5 + (1−p)*1 = 1 + 4p.
  - If I cooperate: expected payoff = p*3 + (1−p)*0 = 3p.
  - 1 + 4p > 3p for all p ≥ 0 (equivalently 1 + p > 0), so defect gives higher expected payoff this round even if the opponent is likely to cooperate.
- With repeated interaction there can be incentives to cooperate to build mutual cooperation, but continuation probability is low (0.25). That makes future punishment/reward less valuable; the threshold discount needed to sustain cooperation is not met here, so the open-loop incentive to defect remains strong.
- The opponent’s single prior move was D, providing at least weak evidence they play defect or are prone to defect. Even if they sometimes cooperate, the short expected horizon and the one-step dominance of D make exploitation attractive.

Decision trade-offs
- Cooperating risks getting 0 (if they defect) and yields at most marginal long-run benefit given the low continuation probability.
- Defecting yields a guaranteed higher expected immediate payoff and small relative cost in future rounds because future continuation is unlikely.

Conclusion
Given the one-shot dominance of defection, the low continuation probability (high chance the game ends), and the opponent’s prior D, the payoff-maximizing choice is to defect.

- In the three recent matches with Opponent_118 (matches 333–335) every recorded round was (D,D): both players defected. That strongly suggests Opponent_118 is an always-defect (AllD) or at least heavily defecting strategy.
- The continuation probability is low (25% to continue, 75% chance of ending) so most encounters are effectively one-shot or very short. That reduces the value of attempts to build cooperative reciprocity.
- Against an opponent who defects reliably, cooperating risks being exploited (you get 0 while they get 5). Defecting guarantees at least the mutual-defect payoff (1) and prevents exploitation.

Strategic conclusion
- Given the empirical evidence of AllD behavior and the short expected horizon, the safe, payoff-maximizing action is to defect. There is negligible benefit to a “probe” cooperation because the opponent has consistently defected and the game is likely to end quickly, so future reciprocal payoffs are unlikely.

That is a very consistent signal that this opponent either always defects or at least defects reliably in the opening rounds. There's no evidence of forgiveness or conditional cooperation from them.

The match termination rule is severe: a 75% chance the game ends after each round, so the continuation probability δ = 0.25 and the expected number of rounds is only about 1.33. With so little weight on future rounds, the incentive to cooperate to build up future mutual gains is weak — the immediate payoff dominates decision-making.

Payoff comparisons for the current round:
- If opponent defects (likely), C yields 0 while D yields 1 — defect is better.
- If opponent were to cooperate (contrary to history), C yields 3 while D yields 5 — defect still yields more.

Given the opponent's past behavior (consistent defection) and the low continuation probability, there is no strategic reason to try to signal cooperation. Defection is the dominant and payoff-maximizing choice here.

Opponent strategy inference: Strong evidence they're an unconditional defector (AllD) or at least highly stubbornly defecting. The current-match opening move (D) matches that pattern.

Decision reasoning: Given opponent almost certainly defects, cooperating now would risk the 0 payoff (while they get 5) with little prospect of being rewarded later. The continuation probability is low (only 25% chance of another round), so there is little opportunity to attempt conditional strategies or rehabilitation. Against an apparently AllD opponent, the myopic best response to avoid the sucker payoff is to defect, securing the safer 1 point.

- In five recent matches (matches 333–337) against Opponent_118 every recorded round is mutual defection (D,D) — no cooperations by them.
- That pattern strongly indicates Opponent_118 is an always-defect (or at least a consistently defecting) strategy.

Strategic implications
- With continuation probability 0.75 the game is moderately long, so if the opponent ever would be cooperative, there could be value in trying to build cooperation. But the empirical record gives no signal of any willingness to cooperate.
- Playing C first risks 0 this round while they D (0 vs 1 if I defect), and giving them a chance to exploit me; a lone probe is unlikely to convert an always-defect opponent.
- Against a confirmed defector, the payoff-maximizing safe action is to defect immediately to avoid being exploited.

Decision
I will defect.

- Continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the match ends after each round), so the effective horizon is very short (expected rounds ≈ 1.33). Immediate payoff dominates incentives.
- Past record vs Opponent_118 (Matches 333–338): all recorded rounds are (D,D). No evidence of cooperation or forgiveness — strong signal the opponent is a persistent defector.

Implications for strategy
- If the opponent is an unconditional defector, cooperating on the first move yields 0 while defecting yields 1, so defect strictly dominates given the observed behavior.
- Given the very short expected horizon, the upside of attempting to “test” cooperation (hoping to start a mutual C path) is small and unlikely to be realized based on the opponent’s history.
- Thus the payoff-maximizing, low-risk choice is to defect.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending each round. My goal is to maximize my score. I have a long history of previous matches.

Looking at the history, I've played against many opponents. A significant number of them cooperated in the first round (C,C). However, there are also several instances where the opponent defected in the first round (C,D). Some opponents have also demonstrated tit-for-tat behavior (C,D followed by D,C). A few have even gone D,D after a C,D.

Without any information about this specific opponent, the best approach is to start with cooperation. This gives the opponent a chance to cooperate as well, leading to a higher payoff for both of us in the long run. If they defect, I can adjust my strategy accordingly in the next round. Given the high probability of the game ending each round (75%), a strategy like Tit-for-Tat might be too slow to recover from initial defection.

Therefore, I will start with cooperation and observe the opponent's response.

- This is the first move of a new match; I have no in-match signals about this particular opponent.
- The match is short: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the continuation probability δ = 0.25. Expected total rounds ≈ 1/(1−δ) = 1.333 rounds — only a small shadow of the future.

Relevant incentives
- One-shot (stage) payoffs: defect strictly dominates cooperate for a single round: defect gives 5 if they cooperate and 1 if they defect; cooperate gives 3 if they cooperate and 0 if they defect.
- With a low continuation probability, future punishments or rewards matter little. The immediate gain from defecting on the first move outweighs the small expected value of trying to establish mutual cooperation.

Opponent inference from past matches
- Across past opponents I often met many unconditional cooperators (leading to many (D,C) outcomes) and many unconditional/long-term defectors (leading to (D,D) sequences). There isn’t reliable information that this opponent will be a long-run cooperator who would make foregoing the immediate one-shot gain worth it.
- Even if this opponent were a pure cooperator, defecting now yields 5 instead of 3 immediately; with δ = 0.25 the expected extra future payoff from trying to signal cooperation is small and unlikely to compensate.

Decision
- Given no in-match information, the low continuation probability, and the dominant one-shot incentive, the expected-utility-maximizing first move is to defect.

- Payoffs: mutual C=3 each; mutual D=1 each; you D / they C =5 for you; you C / they D =0 for you.
- The match is very short: there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round (continuation prob 0.25). Expected number of rounds ≈ 1.33, so the future ""shadow"" is weak.
- The only prior encounter with Opponent_119 (Match 340) ended (D,D). No evidence they are cooperative.

Reasoning
- With such a high end probability, the incentive to try to build long-term cooperation is small; first-round payoffs dominate expected return.
- Given the single previous interaction resulted in their D, the simplest hypothesis is that they will defect (e.g., Always Defect or a mostly-defecting strategy).
- If they defect this round, playing D yields 1 point (instead of 0 if you C). If they were to cooperate (unlikely based on history), playing D would give you 5 (best-case). The downside of cooperating (getting 0 if they defect) is larger than the upside of attempting to coax cooperation given the short expected horizon and prior D.
- So the risk-minimizing, payoff-maximizing choice is to defect.

- After each round there's a 75% chance the match ends, so the continuation probability is only 25%. The expected number of rounds is short (~1.33 rounds). The shadow of the future is weak, so one-shot incentives dominate.

Opponent's observed behavior
- In our two previous encounters with Opponent_119 (Matches 340 and 341) the recorded outcome was (D,D) both times. That suggests Opponent_119 defects at least on the first move and is likely an All-D or otherwise hostile/unchanging defector.

Strategic reasoning
- With such a short expected horizon and with strong evidence the opponent defects immediately, cooperation is dominated: cooperating risks 0 points if the opponent defects, whereas defecting yields at least 1 point (if they defect) and potentially 5 if they unexpectedly cooperate.
- Even if Opponent_119 were a conditional cooperator (e.g., TFT), the tiny continuation probability makes attempting to build cooperation unlikely to pay off enough to offset the immediate exploitation risk.

Decision
- Defect is the payoff-maximizing, robust choice against an opponent who has previously defected twice and given the short expected continuation.

- If opponent defects (most likely), my payoff: D → 1, C → 0.  
- If opponent unexpectedly cooperates, my payoff: D → 5, C → 3 — D still gives a higher payoff.

- This match has already produced two rounds of (D,D). In your prior two matches with Opponent_119 (Matches 340 and 341) the outcomes were also (D,D).
- Opponent_119 has never shown cooperation in any recorded interaction with you — behavior consistent with an Always-Defect or very unforgiving strategy.

Opponent's likely strategy
- The simplest and best fit is Always-Defect (or at least a strategy that defects on the first move and rarely/never cooperates).
- Given no evidence of reciprocation after any of your moves, treating them as a defector is the rational model.

Decision reasoning
- Against a defector, defection strictly dominates cooperation: cooperating while they defect yields 0 vs 5 (bad), while mutual defection yields 1 each.
- There is only a 25% chance the game continues to another round, so immediate payoff matters a lot. The small continuation probability doesn’t justify risking 0 points now for the unlikely chance of future cooperation from an opponent with no history of cooperating.
- Therefore the payoff-maximizing choice is to defect and avoid being exploited.

Payoff check this round: if I play D I get 1 point (mutual defection). If I play C I get 0 (I get exploited). With the continuation probability low (only 25% chance to continue each round), the expected benefit of trying to “seed” cooperation is very small — future rounds are lightly weighted and the opponent has shown no willingness to reciprocate.

- The continuation probability is low (25% chance to continue each round, 75% chance to end), so the expected number of rounds is ≈1.33. This makes the interaction effectively very short — close to a one-shot — reducing the benefit of attempting to build cooperation.

Strategic reasoning:
- Against an always-defecting opponent, cooperating yields the sucker payoff (0) if they defect while I cooperate; defecting yields 1 (mutual defection).

With the continuation probability high for ending (75% chance of ending each round → low continuation probability of 25%), the shadow of the future is weak, so long-run reciprocity has little force here. Against an opponent who will defect immediately, cooperating only risks getting 0 while they get 5; defecting guarantees the safer mutual-defection payoff of 1.

A possible alternative would be to probe with an initial C to see if they switch, but given multiple full matches of consistent (D,D), that probe is unlikely to pay off and is unnecessarily risky.

A significant portion of my initial 'C' moves were met with 'D'. However, blindly defecting from the start isn't optimal as it risks missing out on potential long-term cooperation.

Since I have no information about this opponent, the best approach is to start with a cooperative move. This allows me to gauge their initial response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If they cooperate, I'll continue to cooperate. If they defect, I'll likely defect in the next round to discourage further defection, but I'll keep an eye out for patterns or opportunities to re-establish cooperation.

Therefore, my first move is to cooperate.

- This is the first round of the current match; there is no in-match history to condition on.
- The match ends after any round with probability 75%, so the continuation probability is δ = 0.25. The expected number of rounds is only 1/.75 ≈ 1.33 (very short).

Opponent's strategy (inference)
- I have no information about this specific opponent. From my long cross-match history I mostly played D, so many opponents likely expect me to defect or already adaptively defect. But without in-match signals, I cannot reliably induce long-run cooperation here.

Strategic reasoning
- In a single-shot PD (or very short expected horizon) defection strictly dominates: defect gives 5 if the opponent cooperates and 1 if they defect, both better than cooperating (0 vs 3).
- More formally, cooperation can only be sustained by future punishment if δ is large enough. With payoffs T=5, R=3, P=1, S=0, the standard incentive constraint for grim-trigger cooperation is δ ≥ (T−R)/(T−P) = (5−3)/(5−1) = 2/4 = 0.5. Our δ = 0.25 < 0.5, so the future is too short/discounted to make cooperation self-enforcing.
- Given the short expected horizon and lack of a credible way to enforce future cooperation, the payoff-maximizing action in the first round is defection.

With a 75% chance the match ends after any round, the continuation probability is only 25%, so the future shadow is small and there's limited value in trying to ""win back"" long-term cooperation.

Interpretation of the opponent's action:
- Immediate defection is consistent with AllD, a defect-first tester, or a retaliatory strategy (e.g. Tit‑for‑Tat would defect now because we defected first). It could also be a noisy/random player, but absent evidence otherwise the safest model is that they will defect again or at least will punish attempts to cooperate.
- Given that we already defected on round 1, many conditional cooperators will continue defecting for at least one round.

Expected payoffs for next round:
- If I cooperate and they keep defecting: I get 0 (exploited).
- If I defect and they keep defecting: I get 1.
- If I defect and they (unexpectedly) cooperate: I get 5.
- With low continuation probability, the small chance of building cooperation does not outweigh the exploitation risk.

Given the opponent's initial defection, the high probability the game ends soon, and the asymmetric risk of being exploited by cooperating now, the dominant pragmatic choice is to defect.

- Payoffs: CC=3, CD=0 (you C, they D), DC=5 (you D, they C), DD=1.
- After each round there is a 75% chance the match ends, so the continuation probability is only 25% (delta = 0.25). That makes the interaction very short on average.
- Opponent_120’s only recorded match (Match 347) played D in both rounds (both outcomes were DD). No evidence they open with C or forgive.

Strategic reasoning
- With delta = 0.25 the usual folk-theorem condition for sustaining cooperation fails. A simple threshold calculation: to make mutual cooperation credible, delta must be at least (T−R)/(T−P) = (5−3)/(5−1) = 0.5. Here delta = 0.25 < 0.5, so the future is not valuable enough to deter a one-shot defection.
- Given the short expected horizon, immediate temptation to defect (gain 5 vs 3) dominates the potential future stream of cooperation.
- Empirical signal: Opponent_120’s observed behavior was to defect in both rounds of their previous encounter. That is consistent with an always-defect or at least a non-cooperative strategy. With essentially no prior evidence they’ll cooperate, cooperating first would likely yield 0 (if they defect) while defecting guarantees at least 1.
- Risk-reward: Against possible cooperators defecting yields higher safety and higher expected payoff in this low-delta environment.

Decision
Given the low continuation probability and the opponent’s previous all-defect behavior, defecting is the dominant safe choice.

- Match 347: (D,D), (D,D)
- Match 348: (D,D)
In every recorded round against Opponent_120 they defected; I also defected in those rounds. There is no evidence of testing, conditional cooperation, or noise — the pattern is consistent with an Always-Defect (AllD) strategy.

Game environment:
- Payoffs: CC=3 each, DD=1 each, C while they D = 0 (sucker), D while they C = 5 (temptation).
- Continuation probability per round is low: there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round, so the probability of another round is only 25%. With such a low continuation probability, the shadow of the future is weak; sustaining cooperation is hard even against potentially nice opponents.

Decision reasoning:
- If Opponent_120 truly always defects, my best response is to defect: DD yields 1 point per round for me, whereas cooperating while they defect gives 0.
- The observed history strongly supports the hypothesis Opponent_120 = AllD. The small chance they might deviate to cooperate in the first move is unsupported by past behavior, and the low continuation probability makes trying to coax cooperation even less attractive.
- Thus defecting maximizes my expected payoff against this opponent.

That is strong evidence Opponent_120 is an unconditional defector (or at least highly defect-prone).

With the continuation probability low (75% chance of ending each round → expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds), there is little opportunity or incentive to try to “buy” future cooperation by risking a cooperative move now. Against a defector, cooperation yields 0 this round vs 1 for defecting (and risks giving the opponent 5 if they happen to cooperate). Defection strictly dominates given the observed behavior and the short expected horizon.

Decision: defect.

That strongly suggests Opponent_120 is an unconditional defector (ALLD) or at least defects on the first move.

The environment also has a high 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability 0.25), so there is little expected future to reward a risky attempt at cooperation. If they will defect, cooperating gives me 0 this round vs defecting gives me 1 (and avoids being exploited repeatedly). Even if they might sometimes forgive, past data gives no evidence of that.

Given the empirical evidence and the short effective horizon, the payoff-maximizing move is to defect.

- In five recent matches (Matches 347–351) against Opponent_120 every recorded round was (D,D). No cooperation was ever observed.
- That pattern strongly indicates Opponent_120 is an Always-Defect or highly defect-biased strategy.

Game-theoretic considerations
- The stage-game dominant action is D. Given the opponent’s empirical behavior (virtually certain defection) there is no credible prospect of getting sustained mutual cooperation.
- The continuation probability is low: there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round, so the continuation probability is q = 0.25 and the expected number of rounds is only 1.33. Future rounds have little weight, making immediate payoff dominant.
- Payoff comparisons this round: if opponent defects, D gives 1 vs C gives 0. If opponent (unexpectedly) cooperates, D gives 5 vs C gives 3. D weakly dominates C given the opponent’s observed behavior.

Decision
- Best response is to defect.

That strongly suggests an All-D or very persistent defecting strategy.

Game dynamics: the match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (only 25% chance to continue), so the expected match length is short (~1.33 rounds). That makes the first-round payoff especially important and reduces the value of attempting to build long-term cooperation.

Payoff reasoning: if the opponent defects this round, my payoff is 1 for D vs 0 for C, so defect strictly dominates cooperate in that case. Given the consistent evidence they always defect and the low continuation probability, the expected gain from trying to probe/coax cooperation is small and risky.

Decision: defect.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. My goal is to maximize my score over many rounds, with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round.

Looking at my match history, I've encountered a wide variety of opponents. Many initially cooperated (C), but a significant number defected (D) on the first round. Some opponents seem to Tit-for-Tat like (returning my previous move), others are consistently cooperative, and some are consistently defective.

In this current match, I have no information about my opponent yet. Without prior information, a good starting strategy is to cooperate. This allows me to see if the opponent is also cooperative. If they are, we can both benefit from continued cooperation. If they defect, I can then adjust my strategy accordingly. A strategy of always defecting can be exploitable, and might lead to lower scores in the long run.

Therefore, my first move is to cooperate.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. My goal is to maximize my score.  The game has a 75% chance of ending after each round, so there's a high probability of only a few rounds.

Looking at my match history, I've played against a variety of opponents. Many initially cooperate, but a significant number defect, especially early on.  Some are consistent cooperators, some are consistent defectors, and some seem to be tit-for-tat (or similar). Some matches have multiple rounds, while many end after a single round.

In this specific match, the history is `[(C,D)]`. This means I cooperated in the first round, and my opponent defected.

Given this information, I need to decide whether to cooperate or defect in the next round.  Since the probability of the game ending is high (75%), and the opponent has already defected once, I should likely defect to try and get a higher score before the game ends. This is a risk-averse strategy, as there's a good chance this is the last round. If I cooperate again, and the opponent defects again, I'll get 0 and they get 5, which is very undesirable. If I defect and they cooperate, I'll get 5 and they'll get 0. If we both defect, we both get 1, which is better than getting 0.

Therefore, I will defect.

The match is very short on average: after each round there is only a 25% chance to continue, so the expected total rounds = 1/(1-0.25) ≈ 1.33. Future rounds have little weight.

Opponent model: unknown — previous history against many opponents is mixed (some start C, many start D), so I can't rely on a high probability of long mutual cooperation.

Decision calculus (first-round expected payoffs):
- If opponent cooperates with probability p, payoff(D) = 5p + 1(1−p) = 1 + 4p.
- Payoff(C) = 3p + 0(1−p) = 3p.
Compare: payoff(D) − payoff(C) = 1 + 4p − 3p = 1 + p > 0 for any p ≥ 0. So defect strictly dominates on the first move given the very low continuation probability.

Conclusion: defect this round.

- This is the first round of this match (no current-history).
- The match stops after each round with probability 0.75, so the chance to continue is only 0.25. Expected total rounds is small (~1.33 rounds), so future rewards are heavily down-weighted.

What the opponent’s history suggests
- We met Opponent_121 once (Match 354) and the outcome was (D,D). No sign of reliable cooperation; that single data point weakly suggests defection rather than a cooperative strategy.

Strategic calculus
- One-shot payoff comparison: if opponent cooperates with probability p, Cooperate yields 3p, Defect yields 1 + 4p. Since 1 + 4p > 3p for all p ≥ 0, defection strictly dominates in the one-shot sense.
- With repeated play, cooperation can be worthwhile only if future cooperation is sufficiently likely (continuation probability high). Here continuation probability = 0.25 is low, so the discounted future benefit of establishing cooperation is small.
- Example (grim-trigger style): mutual cooperation forever gives expected total payoff 3/(1−δ) = 3/0.75 = 4. Defecting now and being punished thereafter gives about 5 + δ·1/(1−δ) ≈ 5.33, so defection is better under plausible punishment dynamics.

Conclusion
- Given the opponent’s prior (D in our last encounter), the very low continuation probability, and the one-shot dominance of D, the payoff-maximizing choice is to defect.

- This is my first round in the current match versus Opponent_121, but I have two previous encounters vs the same opponent (Matches 354 and 355), both ended with (D,D). That indicates the opponent either always defects or defects by default in short matches.
- The continuation probability after each round is only 25% (75% chance the game ends), so future rewards are heavily discounted. That makes the incentive to build long-term cooperation weak — the single-shot dominant action is more important.

Opponent strategy guess
- With two prior mutual-defection rounds and the high chance the match ends after one round, the safest model is that Opponent_121 will defect (Always Defect or a similarly defection-prone strategy).
- Even if they sometimes test cooperation, the risk of being exploited (0 vs 5) in this short-horizon game is high relative to the small chance of future reciprocity.

Decision reasoning
- Given the likely opponent defect and the short expected horizon, defecting maximizes my expected payoff (avoids 0 from C when they D, and secures at least 1 instead of risking 0).
- Defection is the best-response under the reasonable belief about the opponent and given the low continuation probability.

That is, they played D on the first move and continued defecting in those encounters. No evidence of initial cooperation or conditional forgiveness exists.

Game environment: the match is short on average (75% chance of ending after each round → expected length ≈ 1.33 rounds), so the first-round payoff dominates expected return. Payoffs make defection strictly better against a defector (1 point for D vs 0 for C if they defect).

Strategy inference and decision: given consistent prior D-first behavior, the safest model is ALLD or at least “defect-first” / unforgiving. Against an opponent who defects immediately, cooperating only loses expected points (0 instead of 1 this round, with little chance to recoup because the game likely ends). Therefore I should defect.

- Each round has a 75% chance of ending, so continuation probability is only 25%; expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds. Future payoffs are heavily discounted, so the immediate payoff dominates.

Opponent behavior
- In all prior encounters with Opponent_121 (Matches 354–357) the sequence is [(D,D)] every time. They defect on the moves we've seen; there is no evidence of them cooperating or of a pattern that can be exploited to build trust.
- Best model given the data: Opponent_121 either plays AllD or at least defects on the first move with very high probability.

Decision reasoning
- With a very short expected horizon, the incentive to try to establish cooperation is weak. Against a likely AllD opponent, cooperating on the first move yields 0 (if they defect) versus 1 if we defect (both D). Defection strictly dominates given the observed opponent behavior.
- Therefore the payoff-maximizing (risk-minimizing) action is to defect.

- In five recent encounters with Opponent_121 (Matches 354–358) every round recorded was (D,D). No instance of them cooperating is visible.
- Current match has no prior rounds; I have no new signal this round.

Inference about opponent
- The consistent (D,D) history strongly suggests Opponent_121 is a pure defector or at least extremely unlikely to cooperate unless provoked by repeated cooperation from me.
- Even if they were a conditional strategy (e.g., tit-for-tat), the observed behavior is that they defect on the first move and continue defecting.

Strategic analysis
- Continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the game ends each round). The future shadow is small, so the incentive to invest in attempted cooperation (to build a cooperative relationship) is limited.
- Against a likely-all-defect opponent, cooperating gives 0 now while they get 5; defecting gives 1 now (mutual defection outcome is safer).
- Given the strong historical evidence and low continuation probability, defecting maximizes my expected total payoff.

- Against Opponent_121 we have five previous matches (Matches 354–358) and in each the pair of moves was (D,D). In the current match the only round so far is also (D,D).
- That history is most consistent with a strategy that defects reliably (ALLD) or at least defects on the first move and rarely/never rewards cooperation.

Game-structure considerations:
- Payoffs: T=5, R=3, P=1, S=0. If the opponent is going to defect, cooperating gives S=0 this round while defecting gives P=1.
- The continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the game ends after each round). With such a low discount/continuation factor, the future value of attempting to establish cooperation is very small; punishment or reciprocation strategies don’t have enough expected future rounds to make cooperation profitable when the opponent is likely to defect.

Decision reasoning:
- Given strong empirical evidence of persistent defection and the low continuation probability (so limited benefit from trying to “train” the opponent), the dominant safe action is to defect. Cooperating now would strictly lower this round’s payoff (0 instead of 1) with little chance of starting a mutually cooperative trajectory.

That strongly suggests an all-defect or extremely unforgiving strategy that defects on the first move and thereafter.

Game environment: the match has a high 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability only 25%), so expected interaction length is very short. With such short games, trying to coax cooperation is costly: a single cooperative move against a defector yields 0 while defecting yields 1, and there's little chance to build a cooperative relationship before the match ends.

Payoff reasoning: against a persistent defector, playing D dominates C (1 point per round vs 0), and given the empirical evidence of always-defect, the rational choice to maximize expected score is to defect immediately.

- Past interactions with Opponent_121 (Matches 354–359) show only mutual defection rounds (all D,D). In the current match the first round was also D,D. This strongly indicates the opponent is an always-defect (ALLD) or otherwise uncooperative strategy.
- Payoff consequences: against a defector, cooperating yields 0 while defecting yields 1 this round. The game has a 25% chance to continue each round (75% chance to end), so the expected number of future rounds is small — there's little opportunity to “train” the opponent toward cooperation.
- Given the opponent's consistent defection and the low continuation probability, the myopic best response is to defect to avoid being exploited and to maximize expected total score.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. My goal is to maximize my score, and there's a 75% chance the game ends after each round.

Based on my match history, I've encountered a variety of opponents. Some consistently cooperate, some consistently defect, and some seem to employ a tit-for-tat strategy (or something similar). A significant number of opponents defect on the first round after I cooperate.

Since this is the first round and I have no information about this specific opponent, I need a strategy that balances cooperation and the risk of being exploited. A purely cooperative strategy would be vulnerable to immediate defection. A purely defective strategy would forgo the potential for mutual cooperation.

Given the high probability of the game ending after each round (75%), the first round is crucial. I want to test the waters and see how my opponent responds. I'll start by cooperating. This allows me to potentially establish a cooperative relationship, but also gives me information about my opponent's willingness to cooperate. If they defect, I can adjust my strategy in the next round (if there is one).

My past performance shows a tendency to initially cooperate (C). However, I've faced a significant number of opponents who defected on the first round. This makes a purely cooperative strategy unsustainable in the long run.

In this specific match, the opponent defected in the first round after my cooperation. This is a clear signal that they are not playing a Tit-for-Tat or similar cooperative strategy. Given the high probability of the game ending after each round (75%), the best approach is to exploit their defection immediately. Continuing to cooperate would likely result in repeated exploitation.

Therefore, I will defect.

My opponent is unknown, but the history of the current match is (C,D), (D,C). This indicates that my opponent is likely employing a Tit-for-Tat strategy, defecting immediately after I defected.

Given that my opponent has already retaliated to my defection, continuing to defect will likely lead to a long string of (D,D) which is not ideal. The best approach now is to cooperate in order to try and re-establish a (C,C) equilibrium.

Therefore, I will cooperate this round.

- The match just started (no history). The continuation probability after a round is only 0.25 (75% chance the match ends), so the expected total number of rounds is 1/(1-0.25) = 1.333… — very short horizon.

Empirical evidence about opponents
- In my prior matches many opponents opened with C (lots of (D,C) pairs in past matches), while a substantial fraction are pure defectors or punishers. That suggests a mixture: many naive cooperators, some retaliators.

Strategic reasoning
- In a one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma defection strictly dominates cooperation. With a short expected horizon (1.333 rounds) the incentive to defect on the first move is very strong.
- Immediate expected payoff comparison: let q = probability opponent plays C on the first move.
  - If I play D: expected payoff = 5*q + 1*(1-q) = 1 + 4q.
  - If I play C: expected payoff = 3*q + 0*(1-q) = 3q.
  - 1 + 4q > 3q for all q (equivalently 1 + q > 0), so defecting yields strictly higher immediate expectation.
- Potential future cost from retaliation is limited because continuation probability is low. Example: if opponent would punish forever after I defect (grim trigger) then cooperating throughout yields expected total ≈ 3 * 1.333 = 4, while defecting first (and being punished thereafter) yields ≈ 5 + 1*(0.333)=5.333 — still better to defect.
- Given the dominance of immediate gain and the small weight of future retaliation, defection is the risk‑dominant and expected-payoff-maximizing choice.

- Only one round so far: (D,D). Both of us defected to start.
- The match termination probability is high (75% chance to end after each round), so the continuation probability is only 0.25. That makes the effective horizon very short.

What the opponent likely is
- Given they opened with D, they are either an unconditional defector or a retaliatory strategy (e.g., Tit‑for‑Tat or Grim) responding to perceived defection. Either way, their next move is more likely to be D than C.
- The long history of past matches shows a heavy prevalence of defecting behaviour across opponents (many repeated D,D matches and many cases where we defected and the opponent cooperated early, but when opponents defect first they tend to keep defecting). That increases the prior that this opponent will defect again.

Decision reasoning
- With such a short expected future (continuation 0.25), the value of attempting to “repair” cooperation is small. The immediate payoffs dominate.
- If I cooperate now and they defect, I get 0 (very bad). If I defect now and they defect, I get 1 (safer). If they were going to switch to cooperation only after I cooperate, the chance of many future cooperative rounds is low because the match probably ends.
- Against both unconditional defectors and retaliators who saw (D,D), defection is the best local response.

- Opponent_122 in our only prior encounter played D both rounds: (D,D), (D,D). That is consistent with an always-defect (AllD) strategy or a very unforgiving defector.
- The continuation probability is low: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round (so continuation prob = 0.25). Expected number of rounds ≈ 1.33. Short expected length makes future reciprocity/value of establishing cooperation small.

Decision reasoning
- If the opponent is AllD, cooperating first yields 0 immediately (C vs D) while defecting yields 1 (D vs D). Defection strictly dominates in that case.
- Even if the opponent might be a conditional cooperator (e.g., Tit-for-Tat), our very short expected horizon and the fact they defected twice previously implies high risk that cooperation will be exploited or not worth the investment.
- Given strong empirical evidence of defection from this opponent and the low continuation probability, the safest score-maximizing move is to defect.

Game structure favors short plays: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the expected number of rounds is low (~1.33). With such a short shadow of the future, the incentive to cooperate to build future mutual gains is weak.

Payoff tradeoffs this round: if they defect and I cooperate I get 0 (very bad); mutual defection gives 1; mutual cooperation gives 3 but requires trusting them to cooperate in future rounds (unlikely given their history).

Game‑theoretic considerations:
- Payoffs make unilateral cooperation very costly when the opponent defects (0 vs 1 if I defect).
- The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (only 25% chance to continue), so the expected remaining interaction is very short.

- With the high per-round end probability (75% chance the match ends after each round), the expected match length is short (~1.33 rounds). That makes long-run cooperation strategies much less valuable.

- Across the tournament history opponents that show this pattern are effectively ALLD (always-defect) or at least extremely unforgiving.

Opponent strategy inference
- Best model: Opponent_122 is an unconditional defector (ALLD) or has no tendency to return cooperation. There is no indication cooperating ever elicits C from them.

Decision reasoning
- Payoffs: mutual defection = 1 each; if I cooperate while they defect I get 0. Against an ALLD opponent, cooperating only lowers my payoff.
- The continuation probability is low (75% chance of ending each round → only 25% chance to continue), so there is little opportunity to build or test long-term reciprocal gains that might justify a risky probe.

Implications: with a high probability the opponent will defect again, so cooperating would risk getting 0 while they get 5. The game has a low continuation probability (only 25% chance to continue each round), so there is limited scope to coax a long-term cooperation payoff even if the opponent were conditionally cooperative.

Given the high probability of the game ending after each round (75%), a purely cooperative strategy is too risky. I need to balance cooperation with the potential for exploitation.

Since this is the first round of the current match and I have no information about this specific opponent, I will start with cooperation. This allows me to assess their initial behavior. If they cooperate, I will likely continue to cooperate. If they defect, I will consider retaliating in the next round to discourage further defection.

- This is the first round with no history against this opponent, so I must weigh one-shot incentives against potential future gains from establishing cooperation.
- Payoffs: C/C = 3 each, D/C = 5 for me, C/D = 0 for me, D/D = 1 each.
- The match has a very high chance of ending after each round: 75% chance of ending per round, so the expected total number of rounds from now is 1/(0.75) = 4/3 ≈ 1.333. That implies expected future rounds beyond the current one of ≈ 0.333.

Reasoning about strategies
- In a one-shot PD defection strictly dominates cooperation (5 > 3). Because the continuation probability is low, the value of future cooperation is small.
- If I defect now while a reciprocator (e.g., Tit-for-Tat) would otherwise cooperate, I gain +2 immediately (5 vs 3). The worst future cost from breaking cooperation is at most the difference between mutual C and mutual D (3 − 1 = 2) per future round. Expected future loss ≈ 2 * 0.333 = 0.667, which is much smaller than the immediate gain of 2.
- Even against strategies that try to forgive or punish for longer, the low expected number of future rounds makes the future penalty insufficient to offset the immediate advantage of defecting.
- Empirical prior from past matches: my archive shows many opponents who defect often or respond to defection, so there is not a strong prior that the opponent is a long-run cooperator that I should trust for many rounds.

Decision
- Given the dominant one-shot incentive, the low continuation probability, and the empirical tendency of opponents to defect, the myopic-optimal and risk-minimizing choice is to defect.

That suggests they at least open with cooperation (or were forgiving that time), but I have no evidence they punish defections harshly beyond a standard TFT-like response.

Game dynamics: the match has a 75% chance of ending after each round, so the expected number of rounds is 1/0.75 ≈ 1.33. That greatly reduces the value of trying to establish long-run cooperation. With such a short expected interaction, the one-shot incentive dominates: defecting when the opponent is likely to open with C yields 5 points now instead of 3 for mutual cooperation, and future retaliation is unlikely to be very costly given the high end probability.

Given the opponent’s prior opening C and the short expected horizon, the best-risk payoff-maximizing play is to defect to exploit that initial cooperation.

Given a high probability the opponent will play C on the first move and the low expected number of future rounds, the immediate gain from defecting (5 vs 3) outweighs the relatively small future benefit from attempting to establish mutual cooperation. Defection is the best payoff-maximizing choice here: it exploits their apparent tendency to open with C with little risk of long-term retaliation (because continuation is unlikely).

Payoff consequences: if they keep cooperating, I get 5 points by defecting vs 3 if I cooperate.

That strongly suggests they are an unconditional cooperator or at least very forgiving.

Given the game’s continuation structure (75% chance the match ends after each round → chance to continue c = 0.25), future rounds are heavily discounted. The standard condition for cooperation to be sustainable (delta > (T−R)/(T−P)) is not met here: c = 0.25 < 0.5, so one-shot incentives to defect dominate.

Compare expected payoffs (c = 0.25):
- If we cooperate throughout mutual cooperation yields 3/(1−c) = 3/0.75 = 4 expected points.
- If we defect at least initially and the opponent retaliates (e.g. TFT or Grim), we get 5 + c/(1−c) = 5 + 0.333... = 5.333.
- If the opponent is actually AllC (as past matches suggest) and we exploit by defecting each round, we get 5/(1−c) = 5/0.75 = 6.666...

Because the opponent appears to be an unconditional cooperator and the continuation probability is low, exploiting by defecting maximizes expected score.

Implications for play now:
- If the opponent is an unconditional cooperator, defecting gives 5 points now vs 3 for cooperating — a clear gain.
- If the opponent is a reciprocity strategy (e.g., Tit-for-Tat) that starts with C, defecting yields 5 now but risks future retaliation. However the continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue each round), so the expected cost of retaliation is limited.

- Opponent_123's prior behavior: in six recent matches (Matches 368–373) they played C while I played D each time [(D,C) repeatedly]. That strongly suggests they are an unconditional cooperator or at least a very forgiving/naive strategy that does not punish defection.
- Payoff comparison for the first move: if they play C and I play D I get 5 (best immediate outcome). If I play C and they play C I get 3. If they unexpectedly punish, there is some downside in later rounds, but given the very low continuation probability and their past unconditional cooperation, that downside is small.

Conclusion and decision:
- Best response to both maximize expected score and exploit the observed strategy is to defect on the first move.

It appears I've played a lot of opponents, and my strategy has generally been to start with cooperation (C). However, I've encountered many opponents who defected on the first round after I cooperated. This suggests that a significant portion of the opponents are either purely defecting, or employing a tit-for-tat strategy, or some other exploitative strategy.

Given the high chance of the game ending after each round (75%), a strategy of always defecting would likely yield a better score than always cooperating. However, against a truly cooperative opponent, I would gain more points by cooperating.

To determine the best strategy for this specific opponent in the current match, I will start with a defection and observe their response. If they cooperate, I will switch to a tit-for-tat strategy. If they defect, I will continue defecting. This approach is based on trying to exploit opponents while also being open to cooperation if they are willing.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The key is to identify opponent strategies and adapt. Looking at my match history, I see a lot of initial cooperation followed by defection. This suggests I started with a Tit-for-Tat-like strategy (cooperate initially, then mirror the opponent's last move) and then switched to more defection. My history shows that opponents defect on me a lot after I initially cooperate, so a purely cooperative strategy is not optimal.

In this current match, the history is very short: `[(D,C)]`. This means I defected in the first round, and the opponent cooperated. A key question is, why did the opponent cooperate? Are they truly a cooperator, or are they trying to bait me?

Given the high probability of the game ending after each round (75%), and only one round played so far, it's a risky situation. If I cooperate now and they defect, I get 0 and they get 5, which is a big loss in such a short game. If I defect again, we both get 1. If they are a true cooperator, I'm missing out on potential future cooperation, but given my history, it's more likely they will defect at some point.

I will defect again. This gives me a guaranteed 1 point, and if they continue to cooperate, I will switch to cooperation on the next round. This allows me to exploit them while they cooperate, and gives me the opportunity to switch to cooperation if they are a true cooperator.

- This is the first round vs a new opponent (no history).
- The match is very short: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the probability to continue is q = 0.25. Expected number of rounds = 1/(1−q) = 1.3333. Future rounds are heavily discounted.

Opponent strategy (uncertain)
- Could be an unconditional cooperator (always C), an unconditional defector (always D), tit-for-tat (TFT), or some other rule. With no history I must plan for the distribution of these possibilities.
- Empirically (from my long record) many opponents start with C (so cooperating first can be exploited), while many others play D often. But I cannot identify this specific opponent.

Decision rationale
- Because the match is short (q = 0.25), the immediate payoff dominates. Compare expected match payoffs (expected over the remaining horizon):
  - If both cooperate every round: 3 per round × expected rounds = 3/(1−q) = 3/0.75 = 4.
  - If I defect now against a cooperator and the opponent then defects thereafter: immediate 5 + expected future mutual-defection payoff (1 per future round × q/(1−q)) = 5 + 1·(q/(1−q)) = 5 + 0.3333 = 5.3333.
  - Against an unconditional defector, mutual defection yields expected total = 1/(1−q) = 1.3333; cooperating first is strictly worse.
  - Against TFT or similar, defecting may provoke future defection, but with q small the future punishment weight is small; exploitation on round 1 often outweighs the reduced future stream.
- Thus defecting is the highest expected-score action against plausible opponent types given the very high termination probability. Cooperating risks being exploited for an immediate 0 payoff (if opponent defects) while the cooperative steady-state (4) is lower than the one-shot exploit value (≈5.33) against cooperators.

- Two previous encounters: Match 375 = [(D,C), (C,D)] (opponent: C then D); Match 376 = [(C,D)] (opponent: D).
- Empirical first-move: 1 cooperation, 1 defection → uncertain but not reliably cooperative.
- In the two-round encounter the opponent defected on the second round, suggesting they are either retaliatory, alternating, or generally prone to defect.

Game-theoretic reasoning
- In a single stage of this PD, defection strictly dominates cooperation (payoffs: T=5, R=3, P=1, S=0). Expected payoff of D = 1 + 4*p(C_opp), of C = 3*p(C_opp); D > C for all p(C_opp) ≥ 0.
- Continuation probability is only 0.25 (75% chance the match ends each round). Expected number of rounds ≈ 1.33, so future gains from trying to establish cooperation are very limited.
- Given the opponent’s mixed/defective behavior and the low continuation probability, the immediate gain from defecting (and avoiding being sucker-punched) dominates possible small future cooperative gains.

Defect.

The continuation probability is low: there's a 75% chance the match ends after any round (only 25% chance to continue), so the expected number of rounds is small (~1.33). With such a short expected horizon, the one-shot incentives dominate: defect strictly dominates cooperate in a single round (payoff D = 5p + 1(1−p) = 1+4p vs C = 3p; D > C for any p ≥ 0).

- This is the first round of this match; I have no moves from this opponent yet.
- The game ends after each round with probability 0.75, so the probability the game continues to the next round is 0.25. The effective discount/continuation factor is δ = 0.25, so the expected number of rounds is small (~1.33).

Opponent strategy (unknown)
- No specific information about this opponent. From the large pool of past matches I’ve seen many opponents are noisy or defect-prone, some are cooperative, and some retaliate. With no signal, I must choose based on payoffs and the short horizon implied by δ.

Incentives and payoff math
- If mutual cooperation continued forever (or while the game continues), expected payoff for cooperating repeatedly = 3 + 0.25·3 + 0.25^2·3 + ... = 3/(1−0.25) = 4.
- If I defect this first round and we thereafter end up in mutual defection (a plausible punishment), my expected payoff = 5 + 0.25·1 + 0.25^2·1 + ... = 5 + 0.25/(1−0.25) = 5 + 1/3 ≈ 5.333.
- Because δ is small, the future loss from deviating is too small to outweigh the immediate gain from defecting (5.333 > 4). Even against a Tit‑for‑Tat or Grim trigger this continuation probability makes one-shot defection attractive.
- Against an unconditional cooperator, defecting gives 5 this round vs 3 if I cooperate. Against an unconditional defector, cooperating gives 0 vs defecting gives 1. In both typical cases, D is at least as good and often strictly better.

Decision
- With no history to encourage trust, and given the low continuation probability which greatly weakens future incentives to sustain cooperation, the payoff-maximizing opening move is to defect.

- Only one round so far: (D, D). Opponent defected in the first round and we defected too.
- The match is very short-lived: there's a 75% chance the game ends after each round (only 25% chance to continue). That makes the future payoff weight small — this is almost a one‑shot interaction.

Inference about opponent
- With only one move observed, plausible strategies include Always Defect, Grim/Tit‑for‑Tat (or any retaliatory strategy), or some noisy/cooperative strategy. Given the prevalence of defecting opponents in prior matches and the fact they defected immediately, the safe prior is that they will defect again (either Always Defect or TFT-like responding to our previous D).
- If the opponent is TFT, they will play D this round (they copy our last D), so cooperating now would be exploited (we get 0, they get 5).
- If the opponent is Always Defect, cooperating is also exploited. If the opponent were a forgiving/cooperative type, cooperating might pay off in future rounds, but because continuation probability is low, the expected benefit of trying to repair cooperation is small.

Decision logic
- Immediate expected payoff considerations: given belief that opponent likely defects this round, choosing D yields 1 (vs. 0 if we choose C and they defect). Choosing D also leaves open the small chance they might cooperate, giving us 5 in that case.
- Because the continuation probability is low, the long-term incentive to try to re-establish mutual cooperation is weak.
- Therefore defecting is the payoff‑maximizing choice under reasonable beliefs.

- Score so far (per round): round1 (D,D) => 1/1, round2 (D,C) => 5/0. Cumulative: you 6, opponent 1.
- We defected both rounds; opponent defected first then cooperated. So opponent switched from D→C after our repeated D.

What the opponent might be doing
- Not TFT or AllD/AllC: TFT would have mirrored our D with a D in round2; AllD would have stayed D; AllC would have cooperated round1. So they’re not a strict mirror or pure defector/cooperator.
- Likely candidates: a forgiving/random player, an alternating tester (D then C), or a strategy trying to bait exploitation after an initial D. They may be exploring or probabilistic (some chance to cooperate even after mutual defection).
- Given they cooperated immediately after we defected twice, they are at least somewhat forgiving or noisy.

Strategic reasoning and decision
- One-shot (myopic) incentives: D strictly dominates C in a single round (5 vs 3 if opponent C; 1 vs 0 if opponent D). With a high termination probability each round (75% chance to end), the expected continuation length is short, so immediate payoff matters more than establishing long-run cooperation.
- Risk of C: if I switch to C and the opponent defects (to punish or because they’re not reliably cooperative), I get 0 while they get 5 — a big swing against me. If I switch to C and they continue to cooperate, I get 3 instead of 5 — smaller loss than the exploitation risk.
- Benefit of D: if the opponent continues to cooperate, I immediately get 5 (best single-round payoff). If they defect, I limit my loss to 1 rather than risking 0. Given I’m already far ahead and continuation is unlikely, defecting is the safe, payoff-maximizing move.

- This is a new match vs Opponent_125. Our only prior encounter (Match 382) was three rounds: their moves were D, C, D while we played D, D, D.
- The match termination probability is high (75% chance to end after any round), so continuation probability is only 25% — the game is very short on average and resembles a near one-shot interaction.

What the opponent’s small sample suggests
- With only three rounds of data, inference is noisy. Opponent_125 mostly defected (rounds 1 and 3) and cooperated once (round 2). That pattern is consistent with a mostly-defect strategy with occasional cooperation or noise, not a reliable reciprocal-cooperator like Tit‑for‑Tat.
- Given that in our prior meeting we always defected and they still cooperated once, they are not strictly punishing immediately every defect (so unilateral defection can sometimes yield the 5-point temptation payoff), but they also return to defection.

Payoff calculus and strategy choice
- Expected continuation is low, so long-term incentives to build cooperation are weak. In this environment the safe/high‑expected payoff action is to defect:
  - If we D while they D → 1 each (safe).
  - If we D while they C → we get 5 (best-case exploitation).
  - If we C while they D → we get 0 (worst outcome).
- With only mixed/noisy evidence of cooperation from Opponent_125, cooperating risks the 0 payoff with little chance to recoup through future reciprocal rounds because the game likely ends quickly.
- Our own history of frequent defections also biases the opponent toward expecting D, reducing the chance that an opening C will reliably prompt mutual cooperation.

Decision
- Play defect to avoid being exploited and to capture occasional sucker-free gains when the opponent happens to cooperate.

- Continuation probability is low (75% chance of ending each round → only 25% chance to continue). Expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds, so the one-shot incentives dominate: defecting is usually the best immediate payoff unless we strongly expect reliable reciprocity.
- In our past encounters with Opponent_125 (Match 382 and 383) the opponent defected almost always. Sequences: (D,D),(D,C),(D,D) and (D,D). That is overwhelmingly defection by them; the single C appears as an outlier (likely noise or a one-off mistake), not a pattern of sustained cooperation.
- Given their history and the short expected horizon, cooperating risks getting 0 points if they defect, while defecting guarantees at least 1 and sometimes 5. There is little reason to try to build cooperation here.

Decision: defect.

Across the three recent matches with them, there were 6 rounds: the opponent played D five times and C only once. In every one of those rounds I played D. The lone C by the opponent appears as an isolated event (in the middle of a match where surrounding moves were D), consistent with noise or a low-probability cooperation rather than a sustained cooperative strategy.

Given that:
- The opponent is very likely to defect on the first round;
- Cooperating first risks a 0 payoff if they defect (while defecting gives me 1 in that case);
- Defect yields a high payoff (5) only if they cooperate, but that happened rarely;
- With the continuation probability high (expected several rounds), trying to build cooperation would only pay off if the opponent were responsive to reciprocal cooperation — the data don’t support that.

So the safe, payoff-maximizing choice against this opponent based on observed behavior is to defect.

- The match usually ends after each round with 75% probability (only 25% chance to continue), so the expected length is short (~1.33 rounds). Future retaliation/cooperation has very little weight.
- In previous encounters with Opponent_125 (Matches 382–385) there were 6 rounds total. The opponent defected 5/6 times and cooperated only once (≈83% defections). Those cooperations came while I was defecting, so they are not a reliable signal of sustained cooperation.
- Payoff incentives in a short game: defecting dominates when the opponent is likely to defect. Against a D-heavy opponent, D gives 1 (mutual D) or 5 (if they unexpectedly cooperate); C risks 0 if they defect (and gains 3 only if they cooperate).

Assessment of opponent strategy
- Opponent_125 behaves like an almost-always-defector (maybe noisy or occasionally giving a lone C). There is no evidence of a forgiving reciprocal strategy that would reward initial cooperation.

Decision
- Given the high chance the game ends immediately and the opponent’s strong defect bias, the safe best response is to defect.

- The game is effectively very short (75% chance of ending each round → continuation probability 0.25), so the one-shot incentive to defect dominates: defecting protects against exploitation and yields higher expected payoff when continuation is unlikely.
- Empirical history with Opponent_125 is strongly defect-biased. Across our recent matches with them:
  - Match 382: [(D,D), (D,C), (D,D)] — opponent mostly defected, with a single cooperation.
  - Matches 383–386: all [(D,D)].
  Overall the opponent almost always plays D; occasional C appears extremely rare.
- Given their heavy tendency to defect, cooperating would usually earn 0 while defecting earns 1 (both-D), so defecting strictly improves my payoff in expectation. The rare cooperation by them is not frequent enough to justify risking exploitation.

- We have played Opponent_125 six recent matches (Matches 382–387). Most rounds were (D,D); only one round was (D,C) (match 382, round 2) where they cooperated while we defected. We never played C against them in these encounters.
- That pattern strongly suggests the opponent is a defector (ALLD or almost-always-D). The single C looks like an anomaly rather than evidence of a forgiving/reciprocal strategy.

Strategic considerations:
- With a 75% chance the game ends after each round (continuation probability 0.25), matches are typically very short. In such settings, the one-shot dominant action is defect; attempts to build cooperation are unlikely to be rewarded given the opponent’s observed behavior.
- If the opponent is indeed ALLD, playing C would give us 0 that round vs their 5; playing D gives us 1 (mutual defection) or 5 if they happened to cooperate. Given their history, expected payoff is higher by defecting and avoids exploitation.

Decision:
- Defect (D).

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

Based on the match history, I've encountered a variety of opponents. Many opponents initially cooperated (C) in the first round. However, a significant number of them defected (D) after I initially cooperated, or defected right away. Some opponents seem to Tit-for-Tat-like, responding to my defection with defection and cooperation with cooperation.

My current opponent is new, and I have no information about their strategy.

A purely cooperative strategy is risky, as many opponents will exploit it. A purely defecting strategy guarantees at least 1 point per round, but it foregoes the potential for higher scores through cooperation. Given the 75% chance of the game ending each round, the initial rounds are particularly important.

Since I have no information about my current opponent, I will start with a cooperative move. This allows me to gauge their response and adjust my strategy accordingly. If they cooperate, I will continue to cooperate. If they defect, I will likely defect in the next round to avoid being exploited. However, I might try cooperating again later to see if they are testing me.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. The key is to balance cooperation to achieve higher mutual rewards with the risk of being exploited by defection. The 75% chance of the game ending each round significantly shortens the expected length of the game. This favors strategies that can quickly capitalize on the opponent's behavior.

Based on my match history, I've encountered a variety of opponents. Many initially cooperated, but a significant number defected, particularly in the first round. Some opponents seem to be tit-for-tat or similar strategies, while others are consistently defecting.

In this current match, the history is very short: `[(C,D)]`. This means I cooperated in the first round, and my opponent defected.

Given this single data point, it's difficult to definitively determine my opponent's strategy. However, their first move being a defection is a strong signal. I need to be cautious about repeated cooperation, as I could be easily exploited.

Considering the short expected game length due to the 75% termination chance, and the opponent's initial defection, a move of Defect seems most appropriate. This serves as a signal that I won't be a pushover and might deter future defections. It also maximizes my potential gain if the opponent continues to cooperate.

- No moves yet in this match. The match is effectively anonymous and starts fresh.
- The per-round probability the match continues is 0.25 (because there is a 75% chance it ends after each round). Expected number of rounds = 1 / (1 - 0.25) = 1.333 rounds on average. So future interactions are very unlikely.

Opponent strategy
- Unknown. With no signals yet I must assume nothing reliable about their future behavior. Even if they are a cooperative strategy, the low continuation probability makes future reciprocation unlikely to matter.

Strategic reasoning
- Payoffs: mutual C = 3 each, mutual D = 1 each, you D/they C = 5, you C/they D = 0.
- In a finitely or very-short repeated PD, defection in the first round is the dominant one-shot action because the prospect of future punishment/reward is too small to sustain cooperation.
- Repeated-game cooperation is sustainable only if the continuation probability δ ≥ (T − R)/(T − P) = (5−3)/(5−1) = 0.5. Here δ = 0.25 ≪ 0.5, so the folk-theorem condition for sustaining cooperation fails.
- Expected immediate gains favor D: if the opponent cooperates, D yields 5 vs 3 for C; if they defect, C would give 0 vs 1 for D. Given the short expected horizon, the upside of exploiting a cooperator dominates the small chance of future reciprocity.

Decision
- Play defect (D).

The match may continue, but with only 25% chance of another round (continuation probability δ = 0.25), so future payoffs are heavily discounted.

Opponent inference: their opening C could be an unconditional cooperator, a forgiving strategy, or a contingent strategy (e.g. Tit‑for‑Tat, Grim) that will punish my D on the next move. From the tournament history and common PD heuristics, many opponents retaliate after being defected on; pure cooperators are rarer.

Decision logic:
- Immediate (next-round) payoffs vs their next move: if they cooperate, D gives 5 vs C gives 3; if they defect, D gives 1 vs C gives 0. So defect strictly dominates on the next round.
- For sustaining cooperation over many rounds, the usual threshold for reciprocal strategies (grim/TFT) is δ ≥ (T−R)/(T−P) = (5−3)/(5−1) = 0.5. Here δ = 0.25 < 0.5, so the future discount is too large to make long‑term cooperation profitable or enforceable.
- Given high chance the opponent will punish my prior D and the low continuation probability, the risk of cooperating (getting 0 if they defect) outweighs any small chance of long mutual cooperation.

Conclusion: play D.

- No moves yet this match. I have one prior short encounter with Opponent_126 (Match 389) where the sequence was: my moves [D, D], opponent moves [C, D].
- That single sequence is consistent with a start-with-C then copy behavior (Tit‑for‑Tat) — they played C first, then played D after I had defected.

Opponent model
- Most likely: a start-with-C then mirror (TFT-like) strategy.
- Other possibilities: an initial cooperative probe followed by retaliation, or simply a 1st-round C then switch to D. In all plausible models they are not a forgiving long-run cooperator given they defected in round 2.

Decision reasoning
- Continuation probability is low: 75% chance the match ends after each round → continuation probability q = 0.25. Expected number of rounds ≈ 1/(1−q) = 1.333.
- Compare expected payoffs (assuming opponent is TFT-like):
  - If I play C now and opponent opens with C: payoff stream is mutual C each round → expected total = 3/(1−q) = 3/0.75 = 4.0.
  - If I play D now: round1 = 5. Opponent will mirror my D in future rounds (D vs D), giving 1 per subsequent round. Expected total = 5 + q*(1/(1−q)) = 5 + 0.25*(1/0.75) = 5 + 0.333... = 5.333...
- Defecting now yields a higher expected score under the plausible opponent models (TFT-like, always-C, always-D, or retaliatory). Given the very short expected match length, the immediate gain from defecting dominates the future cooperative benefit.

- We're in round 2 of this match; round 1 was (You=D, Opponent=C).
- The continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue after each round), so immediate payoff dominates.

Opponent's likely strategy
- In our only earlier match with Opponent_126 (Match 389) the sequence was (D,C) then (D,D): they cooperated in round 1 after our D, then defected in round 2.
- That pattern suggests they may cooperate initially but switch to defection quickly (either a one-shot cooperator or a grudger/defector after seeing continued defection). Across the population most opponents here are defection-prone, and this opponent's observed behavior fits that.
- Given we opened with D, the safest inference for round 2 is that the opponent will defect (they defected in the previous match's round 2).

Decision reasoning
- If opponent defects: C → 0 (sucker), D → 1 (both defect). Defecting avoids the worst payoff.
- If opponent unexpectedly cooperates: C → 3, D → 5. Defecting still gives a higher immediate payoff, but at the risk of provoking future retaliation — however the continuation chance is only 25%, so future retaliation is relatively (probabilistically) less important.
- Given the prior match against this opponent and the short expected horizon, defecting is the dominant safe choice to maximize expected points.

- This is the first round of a new match. The continuation probability after each round is only 0.25 (75% chance the game ends), so the effective discount/continuation factor is low.
- With payoffs (T=5, R=3, P=1, S=0) cooperation can only be sustained by future retaliation if the continuation probability is high enough; here delta = 0.25 < (T−R)/(T−P) = 0.5, so one-shot incentives favor defection.

Opponent history (Opponent_126)
- We played this opponent recently in three matches:
  - Match 389: opponent moves (C, D)
  - Match 390: opponent moves (C, D)
  - Match 391: opponent moves (D)
- Aggregated: opponent has played C twice and D three times across those encounters. They have shown a pattern of cooperating on an opening move in some matches but then defecting on the next round, and sometimes defecting immediately.
- This suggests the opponent is not reliably forgiving or long-term cooperative; they are prone to defect early or retaliate.

Decision reasoning
- Given the low continuation probability (cooperation is not reliably enforceable), and the opponent's history of early/quick defections, the safest expected-value-maximizing play is to defect.
- Defecting yields the temptation payoff if they cooperate (5) and avoids being repeatedly exploited; the expected loss from mutual defection is small because the match likely ends quickly, and the opponent has shown a tendency to defect.

- We played Opponent_126 in four short matches. Their first moves were C, C, D, D. In the two multi-round matches they played C on round 1 then D on round 2 (pattern: C → D). Most of their recent actions are D; overall they defect frequently and often switch to D quickly.

- The match is very short on average: there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round (continuation prob = 0.25), so the expected number of rounds is ≈1.33. The first round therefore dominates expected payoff.
- Payoff math for the first round: if opponent cooperates with probability p, expected payoff playing D = 1 + 4p (1 if they defect, 5 if they cooperate). Expected payoff playing C = 3p (3 if they cooperate, 0 if they defect). For any p ≥ 0, 1 + 4p > 3p, so D strictly dominates C for the first round.

Opponent model and decision
- Opponent_126 appears to favor defection and/or an alternation C→D; they are not reliably cooperative on opening moves. Given the short expected match length and their tendency toward D, defecting maximizes expected points.

- Match continuation probability is low: after each round there's a 75% chance the game ends, so only a 25% chance to continue. That makes the immediate payoff dominant: the next move matters much more than any long-run reciprocity.

Opponent behavior
- In your previous encounters with Opponent_126 they defected very frequently. Across Matches 389–392 they mostly played D (the sequences include (D,C),(D,D) twice, then (C,D), then (D,D)); in particular, they defected against you in recent matches (Matches 391 and 392). Overall the pattern is consistent with an always-/mostly-defect strategy rather than a forgiving or reciprocating cooperator.

Assessment and decision
- Given the low continuation probability (so little prospect of building cooperation) and the opponent’s strong tendency to defect, cooperating now risks getting 0 points if they defect. Defecting guarantees at least 1 point (mutual defection) and avoids being exploited.
- Best response under these conditions is to defect.

- Continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the match ends after each round), so the game is almost a one-shot PD. In near one-shot settings defecting is the dominant short-term move.
- Payoff comparison (single round): Cooperate gives 3 if they cooperate and 0 if they defect; defect gives 5 if they cooperate and 1 if they defect. Even with some chance they might cooperate, defect strictly dominates cooperation in a single round (and with a low continuation probability there is little reason to trade off short-term gain for long-run reciprocity).
- Opponent_126's recent behavior: over five recent matches they mostly defected—many (D,D) outcomes and several (C,D) or (D,D) sequences. They have occasionally played C but frequently defect, including after our C in at least one match (C,D). This suggests they are either mostly-defecting or not reliably reciprocal.
- Given the low expected number of rounds and the opponent's tendency to defect, the safe, payoff-maximizing first move is to defect.

- Multiple recent short matches (Matches 389–394). Overall pattern: overwhelmingly D by the opponent. Examples: many (D,D) rounds across matches 392–394 and match 393 had two (D,D) rounds. There are a few isolated cooperations by the opponent early in matches 389 and 390 (their first move C) and one match where they defected against my cooperation (match 391: (C,D)). But the dominant behavior is defection.

Strategy inference:
- The opponent behaves like a defector-heavy strategy (close to All-Defect or a strategy that quickly settles on defection). Any occasional initial C’s look like probes or noise rather than a stable cooperative policy.
- With a high chance the match will end after each round (75% end probability), rounds are effectively short — making one-shot incentives stronger. Against a likely defector, cooperation is punished (0 points) while defection avoids that loss and can sometimes yield 5 if they err.

Decision reasoning:
- Defection is the dominant safe choice: it prevents being exploited (0 points) and captures the best payoff available when they ever mistakenly cooperate. Given the empirical profile (mostly D), expected payoff is higher with D than with C.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, aiming to maximize my score. The key is to understand my opponent's strategy and adapt accordingly.

Based on my match history, I've encountered a wide range of opponents. Many initially cooperated (indicated by my 'C' followed by their 'C' or 'D'), but a significant number defected at some point. There are also opponents who appear to be tit-for-tat (Opponent_072, Opponent_086, Opponent_103, Opponent_113, Opponent_116, Opponent_117, Opponent_123), and some who always defect (Opponent_089, Opponent_120, Opponent_121, Opponent_125).

Since this is the first round of the current match and I have no information about the opponent, I will start with a cooperative move. This allows me to gauge their initial reaction. If they cooperate in return, I'll continue to cooperate. If they defect, I will have to adjust my strategy.

Observations from the environment:
- Continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the match ends after each round). Expected match length ≈ 1/(1−0.25) = 1.33 rounds — very short horizon.
- With such a short expected horizon, the one-shot incentive dominates: defecting gains 5 vs 3 if the opponent cooperates (a +2 immediate benefit), and the expected future loss from breaking cooperation is small because continuation is unlikely.

Opponent model: unknown. Across past matches I’ve seen many types (some always‑cooperate, many defectors and retaliators), so I can’t reliably expect long reciprocal cooperation here.

Decision logic:
- In a single-shot PD D strictly dominates C. With a low continuation probability, the strategic value of establishing cooperation is minimal.
- Even if the opponent is likely cooperative, defecting now yields the highest expected payoff given the small chance of future rounds and uncertain retaliation.

- This match has just started (no moves yet).
- After each round there is a 75% chance the match ends, so the expected match length is 1/(0.75) ≈ 1.33 rounds. That makes the first round especially important.

What I know about Opponent_127
- We only met them once before (Match 396): they played C while I played D. That single data point suggests they at least sometimes open with cooperation (could be Always Cooperate, Tit‑for‑Tat, or a generally “nice” strategy). There’s no evidence they are a fixed defector.
- Because we lack more history, I must weigh the high chance the match ends after round 1 against the small chance of future retaliation.

Strategic reasoning
- Payoff tradeoff in round 1: if I C vs their C = 3 each; if I D vs their C = 5 for me (best unilateral short‑term payoff). If they defect first, D,D = 1 each (so D vs unknown risks getting 1 instead of 3).
- Given the large probability the interaction ends immediately, the marginal value of preserving cooperation for future rounds is small. Expected future rounds are unlikely enough that risking the immediate higher payoff from defecting is usually optimal.
- If the opponent is Tit‑for‑Tat and would punish in later rounds, that matters only with ~25% chance of a second round; expected loss from retaliation is therefore relatively small compared to the guaranteed extra +2 from defecting now if they cooperate.
- With one prior observation of their cooperating, the safest exploit is to take the one‑round advantage: defecting yields the best expected payoff in this environment.

That strongly suggests they start with cooperation (possibly ALLC or a strategy that opens with C).

Matches are short: there's a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the continuation probability is only 0.25. Expected number of rounds ≈ 1/(1−0.25) = 1.333, so most matches end quickly and the first-round payoff dominates expected return.

Given that:
- If they open with C, defecting immediately gives me 5 points vs 0 if I cooperated.
- The low continuation probability makes potential future retaliation (if they switch to D after being exploited) relatively unimportant to the expected payoff.
- Past behavior shows no retaliation (though those matches ended immediately), and the safest high-expected-value play is to exploit a likely-first-move cooperator.

Decision: defect on the first move.

- Opponent_127 has played three short matches against me (Matches 396–398) and in every recorded round the opponent cooperated while I defected: [(D,C)] ×3. There is no evidence they ever defected or retaliated.
- Payoff structure: D vs C = 5 for me, C vs C = 3 each, mutual D = 1 each, C vs D = 0 for me.
- The continuation probability is very low (only 25% chance the game continues), so future interactions are lightly weighted relative to the current round.

Inference about opponent strategy
- The opponent’s past behavior is consistent with an unconditional cooperator (Always Cooperate) or at least a very forgiving/naïve strategy that did not punish my defections.
- There is no evidence of Tit-for-Tat or grudging strategies that would reliably retaliate after a defection; if they were a retaliator we would expect to see at least one D from them in response to my earlier Ds.

Decision reasoning
- Given the repeated observation that they cooperate even after my defections, the dominant short-term gain is to defect: a single defection against a cooperator yields 5 points vs 3 points for mutual cooperation.
- Because the match is likely to end after each round (75% chance), the future value of establishing cooperation is small, lowering the benefit of being reciprocal.
- The only caution would be if the opponent is pretending to be cooperative but will punish future defections; the historical record does not support that. With the evidence at hand and the low continuation probability, exploiting a likely cooperator maximizes expected payoff.

- In four recent matches (Matches 396–399) Opponent_127 played C on the first move every time while I played D each time; in the one two-round match they also played C in the second round. So their behavior is consistent with an unconditional cooperator (Always C) or a very forgiving strategy that does not punish initial defections.
- The match termination rule makes continuation unlikely: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round (only a 25% chance to continue). That makes this effectively a near one-shot interaction where immediate payoff dominates.

Payoff tradeoff:
- If the opponent cooperates, D yields 5 points vs 3 for mutual cooperation. If they were to retaliate in later rounds, the low continuation probability reduces the expected future cost of a one-shot defection.
- Given the opponent’s past unconditional cooperation and the high chance of termination, the expected gain from defecting on the first move is higher than cooperating.

Decision:
- Defect on the first move to exploit their consistent cooperation and maximize expected score.

- Past matches with Opponent_127 showed they usually cooperated on opening moves (I exploited them often). That pattern suggests a forgiving/naive opener, but here in this match they defected in response to my opening D — so their strategy in this match is retaliatory (e.g., tit‑for‑tat or a punisher).
- The continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue), so the current round's payoff matters most and future cooperation is unlikely to pay off much.
- Given the opponent just played D, cooperating next round would give me 0 if they keep defecting, while defecting gives me 1. If they switch to C, defecting yields 5 (even better). Thus defecting strictly dominates cooperating in the immediate expected payoff.

- That is: in many single-round encounters they played C while I played D; in one two-round match they cooperated both rounds; in the most recent two-round match they defected both rounds.

Inference about opponent strategy:
- Opponent_127 appears unreliable/cooperative in many one-shot encounters (often plays C), but they have also shown clear defection (two full D rounds in the most recent match). There is no clean evidence of strict TFT or steady retaliation — they sometimes cooperate even after being exploited, and other times they defect repeatedly.
- Behavior looks mixed or stochastic, and the most recent data suggest an increased chance of defection.

Game-theoretic considerations:
- Continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue each round), so the shadow of the future is weak. That reduces the benefit of building long-run cooperation from the first move.
- Payoff incentives: defection yields 5 if opponent cooperates, and 1 if both defect. Cooperation yields 3 mutual or 0 if exploited.
- Given the opponent’s mixed/unpredictable behavior and the low continuation probability, the immediate temptation payoff from defecting (5 when they cooperate) outweighs the small expected future benefit of trying to coax cooperation.

Decision:
- To maximize expected score and avoid being exploited by occasional defection, I should defect on the first move.

- Matches 396–399: opponent opened with C repeatedly (we opened with D each time), and even in multi-round match 399 they cooperated in round 1 and round 2 ended up C as well.
- Matches 400–401: opponent switched to opening with D (matches 400: D,D ; 401: D). So their initial move changed from C → D over the last two matches.
- Our play vs them has been heavily defecting on first moves; they appear to have responded by shifting toward initial defection.

Interpretation of opponent strategy
- Early behavior (many openings with C) suggested a naive cooperator or a strategy that starts with C.
- The recent shift to opening D suggests the opponent is adaptive or retaliatory across matches: they may be conditioning their opening move on our recent tendency to defect. They might be using some cross-match memory or a simple ""if you defect often, start defecting"" rule.
- Given the environment (75% chance of ending after each round → short expected matches), the first move is very important.

Decision reasoning
- If I cooperate and they open D (as in the last two matches), I get the sucker payoff 0 (bad).
- If I defect and they open C (as in many earlier matches), I get 5 (good). If they open D, we get 1 each (safe).
- Opponent appears to have adapted to my frequent defections by switching to opening D; that raises the likelihood of facing a D on the first move now.
- To avoid being exploited by their recent D-openings and to maximize expected payoff under uncertainty, defecting is the safer, higher-expected-return choice.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

My past history shows a mixed bag of opponents. Many cooperated initially (indicated by (C,C) in the first round), but a significant number defected when I cooperated (indicated by (C,D)). Some opponents seemed to switch strategies after a few rounds, and a few immediately defected.

Currently, I have no information about my current opponent's strategy. Given the high probability of the game ending early (75%), a cautious approach is necessary.

In the first round, I need to decide whether to cooperate (C) or defect (D). If I cooperate and the opponent defects, I get 0 points, and they get 5. If I defect and the opponent cooperates, I get 5 points, and they get 0. If we both cooperate, we both get 3 points. If we both defect, we both get 1 point.

Since I have no information about my opponent, and the game might end after this round, I'm going to defect. This gives me the best chance of getting a high score if my opponent cooperates, and it avoids the worst-case scenario where I cooperate, and they defect.

The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round, so the expected number of rounds is 1 / 0.75 ≈ 1.33 — the future is very short and the shadow of retaliation/reciprocity is weak.

One-round reasoning: if the opponent cooperates with probability p, expected payoff for Defect = 5p + 1(1−p) = 1 + 4p, and for Cooperate = 3p + 0(1−p) = 3p. Since 1 + 4p > 3p for all p ≥ 0, defecting strictly dominates cooperating for the first move in expectation.

Past matches show many opponents who initially cooperated (we often got (D,C)), but there are also many defectors. Given the very high chance the game ends after the first round, maximizing the immediate payoff is optimal: defecting captures the 5 when the opponent is cooperative and still avoids yielding 0 if they defect.

The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (so continuation probability q = 0.25). That makes the expected number of rounds remaining small (expected future rounds = q/(1−q) = 0.25/0.75 ≈ 0.333).

Opponent inference: The opponent cooperated in round 1. That suggests a “nice” strategy (Tit‑for‑Tat, generous TFT, Always Cooperate, or at least not immediate defect). With only one mutual cooperation, we can’t be sure of long‑term behavior, but the safe worst‑case assumption is that they will retaliate to defection (e.g. TFT or grim trigger).

Tradeoff and expected payoffs (starting now):
- If I keep cooperating forever (mutual C), expected total from now = 3 + 3q + 3q^2 + … = 3/(1−q) = 3/0.75 = 4.
- If I defect now and the opponent retaliates thereafter (mutual D from next round), expected total ≈ 5 (now) + 1·q + 1·q^2 + … = 5 + q/(1−q) = 5 + 0.333… ≈ 5.333.
So, even when accounting for likely retaliation, a one‑time defection now yields a higher expected payoff because continuation probability is low.

Decision: Given the high immediate benefit of exploiting a cooperating opponent and the low chance of enough future rounds for sustained cooperation to outweigh that benefit, I should defect this round.

- Two rounds played: (C,C) then (D,D). We started cooperatively, then defected; the opponent cooperated first round but defected in round 2.
- Continuation probability is low: after each round there is a 75% chance the match ends (so the continuation probability δ = 0.25). That makes the interaction effectively short-lived.

What the opponent’s behavior suggests
- With only two moves, strategy identification is noisy. But the opponent’s move 2 (D) after a mutual C in round 1 indicates they are not a simple reciprocator like Tit‑for‑Tat (which would have cooperated on round 2). They may be defect‑prone, random, or using a strategy that defects early or opportunistically.
- Given they cooperated once, there is some chance they’ll cooperate again, but their immediate defection shows they’re willing to defect and to punish or preempt cooperation.

Game‑theoretic considerations
- For a single round the dominant action is defection (5>3 if opponent C; 1>0 if opponent D).
- With repeated play, long‑run cooperation can be sustained only if the continuation probability is large enough. For these payoffs (R=3, T=5, P=1, S=0), grim/TFT cooperation requires δ ≥ (T−R)/(T−P) = (5−3)/(5−1) = 0.5. Our δ = 0.25 < 0.5, so the incentive to sustain cooperation through future retaliation is insufficient.
- The opponent’s observed defection in round 2 makes the risk of being exploited if we cooperate now nontrivial.

Decision
- Given the short expected horizon and the opponent’s willingness to defect, defecting now maximizes expected payoff and avoids being exploited.

Against Opponent_128 in the previous encounter they opened with C then settled into mutual defection (sequence: C, D, D). That suggests they may be willing to begin with cooperation but quickly switch to defection (or mirror defection). That makes the first-round cooperation risky to exploit for a possible short future reward.

Given the high termination chance (low continuation), the strict single-round advantage of defect, and the opponent’s past tendency to move to D soon, defecting now maximizes expected payoff.

- Two past matches vs Opponent_128: Match 403 = (C,C), (D,D), (D,D); Match 404 = (D,C).
- Opponent opened with C in both matches we saw. When we defected in a later round (Match 403 round 2) the opponent defected thereafter; in the single-round match they cooperated while we defected (we got 5).

Interpretation of strategy
- The opponent appears to be a generally cooperative opener (likely plays C on the first move) but will defect afterwards with nonzero probability or in response to defections. There is evidence of retaliation after we defected (Match 403), though the pattern is noisy.
- The environment is effectively one-shotish: after each round there's a 75% chance the match ends (continuation probability = 25%), so future punishment/reward has low expected weight.

Decision reasoning
- Because the opponent reliably tends to open with C, defecting on the first move yields the highest immediate expected payoff (5 instead of 3).
- The small continuation probability makes the cost of possible retaliation in later rounds minor relative to the immediate 5-point gain.
- Given the observed behavior (cooperative openings and some retaliation later), the risk of severe long-run loss is small here.

- We have played one round this match and it was (D,D) — both sides defected and each got 1 point.
- Continuation probability is low: after each round there is a 75% chance the match ends, so expected remaining rounds are small (0.25/(0.75) if geometric), making immediate payoffs much more important than long-run reciprocity.

What the opponent appears to be doing
- In previous encounters with Opponent_128 they opened with C (Match 403 first round was C, Match 404 single round was C) and then mirrored defections thereafter (in Match 403 they played D after we defected). That is consistent with a Tit‑for‑Tat style or a mimic/TFT-ish strategy.
- However, in this current match they played D in the first round. Given our long history of defecting heavily, Opponent_128 may be using a reputation-sensitive opener (start D vs known defectors) or simply a variant of TFT that sometimes opens D. Either way, their behavior is consistent with a strategy that retaliates or mirrors defections.

Best-response reasoning
- If Opponent_128 is TFT-like, they will likely play our previous move (we played D last round), so they are likely to play D next. If I switch to C I risk being exploited (0 points if they play D). If I play D I secure 1 point (D,D) which is safer.
- Because the game is likely to end soon, the value of trying to re-establish cooperation is small; immediate safe payoff dominates.

- Current match so far: two rounds, both (D,D). The match is likely to be very short because there's a 75% chance the game ends after each round (so continuation probability q = 0.25).
- With q so small, future rounds are unlikely; immediate payoffs dominate expected return.

Opponent's strategy (inferred)
- Against this opponent I’ve seen mixed behavior across past encounters but a lot of defection: in the last two prior matches they followed up initial cooperation with consecutive Ds (Match 403: (C,C),(D,D),(D,D)) and in the most recent past small encounter they cooperated while I defected (Match 404: (D,C)). Overall they appear to defect often and/or respond with defection; in the current match they have defected both rounds.
- There’s no clear pattern that reliably rewards cooperation (no stable mutual-C sequence here). Given the opponent’s frequent defection and the low continuation probability, cooperation is likely to be exploited.

Decision reasoning
- One-shot dominant action is D; with q = 0.25 the incentive to build long-term cooperation is weak. The opponent’s recent behavior (two straight defections now and many defections previously) makes cooperation risky.
- Defecting now protects against exploitation and maximizes expected payoff given the likely short remaining interaction.

- This match so far: three consecutive mutual defections (D,D) x3. That is a strong recent signal the opponent is defecting now.
- In past encounters with Opponent_128 they have sometimes cooperated (Match 403 started with C,C, and Match 404 had them play C while I played D), but their behavior is inconsistent and they have also played repeated D,D rounds.

Opponent’s likely strategy
- The current run of play (D,D,D) suggests they are either an always-defect / mostly-defect strategy or a defector who does not reliably reciprocate cooperation. They may sometimes be a naive cooperator in isolated rounds, but they are not reliably cooperating in multi-round interactions here.

Decision reasoning
- The continuation probability is low (25% chance to continue each round), so the horizon is short and the one-shot incentive to defect is strong.
- Payoff comparisons this round:
  - If I play D: get 1 if they D, 5 if they C.
  - If I play C: get 3 if they C, 0 if they D.
- Given their recent three defections and inconsistent past cooperation, the probability they will cooperate now is low. Defecting avoids the 0 payoff risk and yields at least 1 (and possibly 5 if they unexpectedly cooperate). Over a short expected remaining horizon, defections dominate.

- Four rounds played, all (D,D). The interaction has already fallen into mutual defection and there is no sign of the opponent switching to cooperation in this match so far.
- The game has a very high end probability each round (75% chance of ending), so the continuation probability is only 25%. Future rounds are unlikely and therefore have small weight.

What the opponent is likely doing
- Opponent_128 has shown some initial cooperation in earlier phases (match 403 started with (C,C); match 404 had them play C while I played D). That suggests they can start “nice” but in multi-round contacts they retaliate or settle into defection after I defect.
- In the current match they have defected every round so far despite repeated D from me; this is consistent with either AllD or a retaliatory strategy (e.g., suspicious TFT / Grim) that does not forgive while I keep defecting.
- Given my frequent defections in past encounters and the current sequence of all D, the safest model is that the opponent will continue to defect if I defect.

Decision reasoning
- Immediate payoffs: D vs D = 1, C vs D = 0, D vs C = 5, C vs C = 3.
- Because continuation probability is only 0.25, the expected future benefit from trying to “seed” cooperation by playing C is very small. If I play C now and the opponent remains D (which is likely), I get 0 immediately and only a small chance to reach a future round where cooperation could pay off.
- If the opponent is retaliatory, a single C may not be enough to change their behavior; if they are AllD, C is strictly worse.
- Given the heavy discounting of future rounds and the opponent’s persistent defection in this match, defecting now maximizes expected payoff.

- Continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the game ends after each round), so the match is very short on average (expected rounds ≈ 1.33). That makes one-shot incentives dominant.
- Payoffs: C/C = 3 each, D/D = 1 each, D vs C = 5 for defector, C vs D = 0 for cooperator. In a single round defect strictly dominates cooperate: E(D) = 5p + 1(1−p) = 4p+1, E(C) = 3p, so E(D) − E(C) = p+1 > 0 for all p.

Opponent_128 behavior
- Across prior encounters with this opponent you saw 10 rounds total: they cooperated 2 times and defected 8 times. Several matches were sequences of persistent mutual defection (e.g. five rounds of D/D), and there are multiple instances where they defected while you cooperated.
- That history suggests they are largely a defector (or at least unreliable to reciprocate cooperation).

Decision reasoning
- Given the very short expected interaction and that defection is a dominant one-shot action, combined with Opponent_128’s strong tendency to defect, the payoff-maximizing move is to defect. Attempting to cooperate to start a reciprocal cooperation chain is unlikely to pay off here.

- Opponent_128's recent matches: mostly defecting. Records: sometimes opened with C (Match 403 round1, Match 404 single), but many matches are all D (Match 405 five rounds of D, Match 407 D, Match 406 they defected at our C).
- Overall pattern: heavy bias toward defection, with occasional isolated cooperations—consistent with an AllD-like or noisy-defector strategy rather than a reciprocating/coaxing one.

Game-state factors
- The match almost certainly ends quickly: 75% chance of ending after each round → expected length ≈ 1.33 rounds. Very little opportunity to build long-term reciprocal cooperation.
- Payoff incentives: in a short/one-shotish environment, the myopic best response is to defect (5 vs 3 if opponent cooperates; 1 vs 0 if opponent defects after I cooperated).

Risk analysis
- If I cooperate and opponent defects (the much more likely case given history), I get 0 while they get 5 — large exploitation risk.
- If I defect, I secure at least 1 point even when they defect, and I gain 5 when they naïvely cooperate.
- Given opponent's heavy defection history and short expected interaction, attempting to induce cooperation is unlikely to pay off and is risky.

- Six previous matches, totaling 12 rounds.
- Opponent's moves by round: C, D, D, C, D, D, D, D, D, D, D, D (2 C, 10 D).
- Patterns: one early cooperation (match 403 started C,C) and one solitary cooperation (match 404), but the overwhelming tendency is to defect in almost every round and to defect after any mix of moves.

Game-state and strategic assessment
- The opponent behaves like a mostly-defecting strategy (near-Always-Defect, possibly with an occasional initial C). There is no reliable pattern of sustained mutual cooperation to exploit.
- The PD has a high termination probability per round (75% chance of ending each round). Expected match length is very short (~1.33 rounds). With such short horizons, the incentive to establish long-run cooperation is weak.
- Given the opponent’s empirical tendency to defect and the short expected continuation, cooperation is likely to be exploited (0 points) rather than to produce recurring mutual 3s.

Decision
- Best expected immediate payoff comes from defecting: it avoids exploitation and matches opponent’s frequent defections.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. I have a 75% chance of the game ending after each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

My history shows that I have mostly cooperated in the first round. I've faced a range of opponents, some of whom cooperate, some of whom defect, and some who seem to play tit-for-tat or similar strategies. A significant number of opponents have defected in the first round when I cooperated.

In this current match, the history is `[(C,D)]`. This means I cooperated, and the opponent defected.

Given this information, I should consider the following:

*   **Tit-for-tat:** If I believe the opponent is playing tit-for-tat, I should defect this round to punish their defection in the first round.
*   **Always Defect:** Some opponents always defect. In that case, I should also always defect.
*   **Random:** If the opponent is playing randomly, my best strategy is to defect to maximize my expected payoff.
*   **Forgiving:** Some opponents might be forgiving, but I don't have enough information yet to determine if this opponent is forgiving.

Since the opponent defected in the first round, and I have no other information about their strategy, the best approach is to defect. This punishes their initial defection and signals that I won't be a pushover. It also protects me from being exploited if they are an ""always defect"" player.

- This is the first round of a new match (no prior moves).
- The match is very short on average: there's a 75% chance the match ends after any round, so continuation probability δ = 0.25 and expected total rounds ≈ 1.33. That makes this effectively almost a one-shot PD.

Payoff considerations
- Payoffs: (C,C)=3 each, (D,D)=1 each, (D,C)=5 for me, (C,D)=0 for me.
- In a single round the dominant action is D: no matter what the opponent does, defecting yields a strictly higher immediate payoff (5 vs 3 if they would cooperate; 1 vs 0 if they defect).
- Because δ is small, the expected benefit from establishing long-run cooperation is tiny. Example with a grim-trigger opponent: cooperating now gives expected payoff 3/(1−δ)=3/0.75=4; defecting now yields 5 immediately plus only small future payoff (5 + δ/(1−δ)=5.333…). Defection is strictly better even when accounting for future cooperation strategies.

Opponent inference from history
- Over many past opponents you faced, a large fraction defected frequently (many (D,D) and (D,C) rounds). Some opponents cooperated, but given the short expected length and heavy prevalence of defecting opponents, the safest expectation is that defecting is either best-response or that you cannot reliably induce sustained cooperation.

Decision
- Given the near one-shot nature (high chance of immediate termination) and the payoff math, defecting maximizes expected score.

- The match is essentially very short: there's a 75% chance of ending after each round, so continuation probability δ = 0.25 and the expected number of rounds is only ~1.33. Future retaliation or reward carries very little weight.
- Opponent_129 has one prior encounter (Match 410) where they played D (the outcome was (D,D)). That's weak evidence, but it leans toward a defecting tendency rather than a reliably cooperative one.
- In a near–one-shot PD (δ small), defection is the payoff-dominant choice: against a cooperator D yields 5 vs C yields 3; against a defector D yields 1 vs C yields 0.

- This is the first round of the current match; no moves yet.
- Opponent_129 was met twice previously (Matches 410 and 411) and both recorded rounds were (D, D) — opponent defected in both observed encounters.

Opponent model
- Two clean observations of opponent defecting is limited but consistent with either (a) an always-defect strategy or (b) a strategy that defects in response to defection (or defects first).
- There is no evidence opponent will reliably cooperate if I cooperated; nothing suggests a forgiving/cooperative policy.
- The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability = 0.25). That makes future rounds unlikely, reducing the value of attempting to build cooperation.

Payoff reasoning
- Payoffs: CC = 3, DD = 1, C (me)/D (them) = 0, D/C = 5.
- If opponent defects (most likely), cooperating yields 0 while defecting yields 1 — defect strictly dominates in that case.
- With very low continuation probability, prospective future gains from trying to establish cooperation are small; the one-shot incentive to defect is strong.
- The small sample of prior interactions and the high end-of-game probability together make defection the safer expected-value-maximizing choice.

In a repeated game with continuation probability 0.75 (expected ~4 rounds), cooperation can pay off only if the opponent is willing to reciprocate.

- The match continuation probability is low: there is a 75% chance the game ends after any round, so the continuation probability δ = 0.25. That makes future retaliation or reward relatively weak.

Inference about opponent
- Opponent_129 behaves like an always-defect (ALLD) or strongly defect-biased strategy (defects against both C and D). There is no evidence they will switch to cooperating if I cooperate.

Decision reasoning
- Given opponent’s consistent defection, cooperating now would almost certainly yield 0 this round (C vs their D) and only a small chance of future rounds to recoup via mutual cooperation.
- Defecting now guarantees at least 1 point this round (D vs D) and avoids being exploited.
- With δ = 0.25, the expected value of attempting cooperation for possible future gains is small, and against an ALLD opponent it’s essentially zero.

The game has a high 75% chance of ending after each round (low continuation probability), so the chance of future rounds where cooperation could be rewarded is small. Given the opponent’s history and the short expected horizon, the myopic best response is to defect: cooperating now risks getting 0 this round if they continue to defect, whereas defecting guarantees at least the mutual-defection payoff (1) and preserves the possibility of exploiting a surprising cooperation (5).

So the opponent’s empirical behavior is consistent with All‑D.

Strategic considerations: payoffs make unilateral defection attractive (5 vs 0) and mutual defection (1) is better than being suckered (0). The match has a high 75% chance of ending after each round (only a 25% continuation probability), which greatly reduces the value of trying to build cooperation — the shadow of the future is weak, so one-shot incentives dominate.

- That is strong evidence the opponent is a consistent defector (AllD or very close to it).

Implications for strategy
- Against an opponent who defects reliably, cooperating only exposes us to the 0 payoff (we cooperate, they defect) while defecting guarantees at least 1 (mutual defection).
- The continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue each round), so there is little prospect of long-run reciprocal gains from trying to “teach” cooperation. The short expected horizon favors myopic best responses.
- Given the empirical behavior (they do not reciprocate when we’ve cooperated), there is no reason to incur the risk of being exploited to try to start cooperation.

- With a 75% chance the game ends after each round (only 25% continuation), the effective shadow of the future is small, reducing the benefit of attempting cooperation first. Against an opponent who will almost certainly defect, cooperating risks getting 0 while defecting guarantees at least 1.
- Given opponent’s history and the short expected horizon, the payoff-maximizing, risk-averse choice is to defect immediately to avoid being exploited.

- Continuation probability is low (only 25% chance the game continues each round), so future rewards from trying to build cooperation are small. Immediate payoffs matter more.
- Against a cooperator, D yields 5 vs C yields 3; against a defector, D yields 1 vs C yields 0. So if opponent defects, C is strictly worse.

Opponent behavior
- In our recent interactions with Opponent_129 (Matches 410–415) the opponent defected in every recorded round:
  - Matches 410–412: (D,D) each round.
  - Match 413: they defected while we cooperated (C,D).
  - Match 414: six rounds of (D,D).
  - Match 415: (D,D).
- That record strongly indicates Opponent_129 is an all-defect or at least a persistent defector who does not reward cooperation.

Strategy choice
- Given the opponent's consistent defection and the low chance the game continues (so little prospect of future reciprocity), cooperating would be exploited (we got 0 in match 413 when we played C).
- Defecting avoids exploitation and yields the best guaranteed immediate payoff (1 instead of 0 against this opponent), and there's no reliable evidence that a one-shot probe C will be reciprocated.

- Only one round so far in this match: (D,D).
- The match is likely to be short: 75% chance the game ends after any round → continuation probability δ = 0.25, so expected additional rounds = δ/(1−δ) = 0.25/0.75 ≈ 0.333.

Opponent's strategy (inferred)
- Across many past encounters with Opponent_129 they defected almost always:
  - Matches 410–412, 414–415: all recorded moves are D by them each round.
  - Match 413 they defected when I played C.
- This strongly indicates an All‑D or near‑always‑defect strategy (no sign of reciprocation or forgiveness).

Payoff consideration
- Mutual D yields 1 point for me; if I switch to C while they keep defecting I get 0 (worse).
- Mutual cooperation (3 each) is desirable only if I can reliably induce cooperation — but opponent shows no history of cooperating or responding positively.
- With δ = 0.25 the match is unlikely to continue long enough to recover the short‑term loss from unilateral cooperation even if I could eventually establish cooperation.

Decision
- Given the opponent's consistent defection and the low continuation probability (small chance to build cooperation), the safe utility‑maximizing action is to defect.

I'm facing a new opponent with no prior history. My overall strategy in this iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is to start with cooperation (C) and then adapt based on the opponent's behavior. This approach allows me to identify cooperative opponents and establish mutual benefit, while also providing a chance to detect and punish defectors.

Looking at my past matches, a significant number of opponents initially cooperated (shown by the numerous `(C,C)` entries). However, a substantial portion also defected when I cooperated first (`(C,D)`). Some even continued to defect after I defected in retaliation (`(D,D)`). There are also some opponents who appear to be playing tit-for-tat or a similar strategy (`(C,D), (D,C)`).

Since I have no information about this specific opponent, the best first move is to cooperate. This gives the opponent a chance to cooperate as well, and if they do, we can both benefit. If they defect, I can adjust my strategy in the next round.

Therefore, my decision is to cooperate.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

My match history shows a variety of opponents. Many initially cooperated (C,C), but a significant number defected when I cooperated (C,D). Some opponents have reciprocated after I defected (D,C), and some have continued to defect (D,D). This suggests a mix of strategies in the pool.

In the current match, the history is simply [(C,D)]. This means I cooperated, and my opponent defected.

Given this information, several strategies are possible:

1. **Tit-for-Tat (TFT):** Cooperate on the first move, then mirror the opponent's previous move.
2. **Grim Trigger:** Cooperate until the opponent defects, then always defect.
3. **Pavlov:** Cooperate if the previous moves were the same (both C or both D), and defect if the previous moves were different (one C and one D).
4. **Always Defect:** Always defect, regardless of the opponent's moves.
5. **Random:** Choose C or D randomly.

Since my opponent defected on the first move, a TFT strategy would dictate that I defect this round. Grim Trigger would also suggest defecting. Pavlov strategy would also suggest defecting as the previous moves were different (C,D).

Given the high probability of the game ending after each round (75%), and the fact that the opponent defected on the first round, I should defect to try to maximize my immediate gain.

The match will continue with high continuation probability (0.75), so this is an iterated encounter with expected ~4 rounds, but the opponent’s type is unknown.

Relevant payoffs and incentives:
- Immediate best response to an unknown move is D (5 if they C, 1 if they D) rather than C (0 if they D, 3 if they C).
- If the opponent is a reciprocator (Tit-for-Tat / nice strategy), opening with C can lock in mutual cooperation (3 per round) which is good over multiple rounds. But opening with D risks provoking persistent mutual defection against reciprocators.
- If the opponent is an exploiter or all-defect, opening with C yields 0 while D yields at least 1. Thus cooperating first exposes us to potential exploitation with a large downside.
- Given no signals about this particular opponent, the safe expected-value reasoning favors avoiding the large downside of being exploited on round 1. Defect also gives the chance to exploit naive cooperators immediately.

Empirical context (from my past matches): the population contains many defectors or strategies that defect at least sometimes. With high uncertainty and asymmetric losses from being exploited (0 vs 5), minimizing that downside is priority.

Decision: defect on the first move to avoid exploitation and to test opponent reaction; adapt in later rounds if the opponent shows forgiving/reciprocating behavior.

My only data on Opponent_130 is from Match 417 where they opened with C (we played D). So the opponent has at least once cooperated to a first move.

Key parameters:
- Per-round end probability = 0.75 → continuation probability δ = 0.25.
- Expected number of rounds ≈ 1/(1−δ) = 1.333.
- Payoffs: CC=3 each, DC=5 for defector, CD=0 for cooperator, DD=1 each.

Reasoning about strategies and expected values:
- If the opponent is a cooperator/TFT-like (starts C and retaliates after a defection), then:
  - If I cooperate from the start, expected payoff ≈ 3 * 1.333 = 4.0.
  - If I defect immediately and thereafter both defect (or they retaliate), payoff = 5 this round + expected future payoff of 1 per remaining expected rounds: 5 + δ/(1−δ)*1 = 5 + 0.333... = 5.333...
  - So even against TFT/grim, defecting now yields higher expected payoff because the game is short (low δ).
- If the opponent is an unconditional cooperator, defecting is even better (5 per round vs 3).
- If the opponent is a defector, defecting avoids getting 0 and yields at least 1.

Given the very high probability the match ends after the first round and the single observed previous move by this opponent was cooperation, the short-term gain from defecting on the first move dominates potential longer-term benefits of establishing cooperation.

Decision: defect on the first move.

In that setting the first-round incentive is almost identical to a one-shot Prisoner's Dilemma: defect strictly dominates cooperate for the immediate payoff (D gets 5 vs a cooperating opponent, 1 vs a defecting opponent; C gets 3 vs C, 0 vs D). With δ so small, the value of trying to establish long-run mutual cooperation is minimal.

Opponent_130's past behavior is inconsistent: in our earlier meetings they cooperated in one encounter (we played D,C) and defected in another (D,D). That gives no reliable signal that they will reciprocate cooperation now; they could be a naive cooperator (worth exploiting) or a defector (worth not trusting). Given the low continuation probability, the expected gain from risking cooperation (to try to elicit future cooperation) is small compared with the immediate gain from defecting if they cooperate.

- The continuation probability is low: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the per-round continuation probability is only 25% (expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds).

- In a short/one-shot setting, defection strictly dominates cooperation in expected payoff terms: EV(D) = 1 + 4p (where p is opponent cooperation probability) vs EV(C) = 3p; 1 + 4p > 3p for any p ≥ 0, so D gives a higher expected payoff.
- History vs Opponent_130: three recent matches — first they cooperated while we defected (we scored 5), then two matches ended with mutual defection. That suggests they are not reliably cooperative and have defected subsequently.
- Given the low continuation probability and the opponent's tendency to defect in recent encounters, the payoff-maximizing play here is to defect.

- Against Opponent_130 we have four prior single-match encounters: one where they cooperated while I defected (D,C) and three where we both defected (D,D), i.e. their recent behavior is overwhelmingly defection.
- There is no ongoing in-match history for the current match; this is the first round decision.

Inference about opponent strategy:
- The opponent is not reliably cooperative. The single (C) occurrence could be an opener, noise, or a one-off; the follow-up three matches with initial D suggest they often open/return D and are at best noisy or mostly-defective.
- There is no strong signal they will reciprocate cooperation in a sustained way.

Strategic implications given termination probability:
- The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability only 25%), so the expected number of rounds is low. That makes the first-round payoff much more important relative to long-run reciprocity.
- Cooperating in hopes of eliciting future cooperation is risky: if they defect, I get 0 instead of 1 (if I had defected and they defected). If I defect, worst case is mutual defection (1), best case is exploiting a cooperative opener (5). With the opponent appearing mostly defecting, the safer, higher expected payoff is to defect.

Game is effectively short: there's a 75% chance the game ends after each round (continuation probability 25%), so expected remaining rounds are low. In such a short-ish iterated PD, the incentive to risk cooperation to build a long-term mutually beneficial relationship is weak; immediate gains dominate.

Immediate expected payoffs (using observed coop rate ~0.4 as a rough guide):
- If I play D: E ≈ 0.4*5 + 0.6*1 = 2.6
- If I play C: E ≈ 0.4*3 + 0.6*0 = 1.2

- Per-round payoffs: (C,C)=3, (D,D)=1, (D,C)=5, (C,D)=0.
- Game likely stops after each round with 75% probability — continuation is unlikely, so future deterrence/reciprocity has little weight.

Opponent_130's past behavior
- Six previous encounters: their moves were C, D, D, D, C, D. You defected every time.
- That is 2 cooperations vs 4 defections — overall tendency toward defection with occasional cooperation. No clear pattern of forgiving/responding to my play that would reliably reward initial cooperation.

Decision reasoning
- With a short expected horizon, the immediate payoff dominates strategy choice. Defecting yields 5 when they cooperate and avoids being suckered (0) when they defect. Cooperating risks 0 against their frequent defections and only gains 3 in the rare mutual cooperation cases.

- We played D and Opponent_130 played C in the first round of this match: we got 5, they got 0.
- Continuation probability is low: after each round there is a 25% chance the game continues (75% chance it ends). Future rounds are thus heavily discounted.

What opponent behavior looks like
- In six recent matches vs Opponent_130 they cooperated only twice (including this match) and defected the other times. They have not behaved like strict TFT (they sometimes cooperate despite our defection) nor like a consistent cooperator; behavior looks noisy or occasionally generous but not strongly retaliatory.
- Given they cooperated this first round despite our defection, they appear unlikely to punish with certainty in the next round.

Decision reasoning
- With a single-round payoff tradeoff and low continuation probability, the immediate gain from defecting against a cooperating opponent (5 points vs 3 if we cooperate) dominates.
- Opponent's past play gives little evidence they will reliably retaliate in future rounds; even if they do, continuation is unlikely and the future loss is small in expectation.
- Therefore the score-maximizing choice is to defect again.

Since I have no information about the current opponent, I will start with a cooperative move. This allows me to gauge their initial response and adjust my strategy accordingly.

- This is the first move of a new match (no prior moves in this match).
- The match is very short on average: there is a 75% chance the game ends after any given round (continuation probability = 0.25). Expected number of rounds ≈ 1/0.75 ≈ 1.33 rounds. Future rounds are unlikely and worth much less than the immediate payoff.

Opponent strategy (inferred)
- Across past matches many opponents cooperated on the first move (there are many (D,C) outcomes in my history, i.e. I defected while they cooperated), though there are also many pure-defectors.
- With such a low continuation probability, even opponents who use conditional strategies (tit-for-tat, forgiving strategies) cannot credibly threaten large future punishment because there are few expected future rounds.

Decision reasoning
- In a one-shot PD defection strictly dominates cooperation: defecting yields 5 if the opponent cooperates (vs 3 for cooperating) and 1 if they defect (vs 0 for cooperating). With continuation probability only 0.25, the expected future benefit from sustaining cooperation is too small to overturn the one-round incentive to defect.
- Given the opponent pool often cooperates initially, defecting typically yields the high exploitative payoff (5) on round 1. Defecting also prevents being exploited if the opponent defects.
- Goal is to maximize total score across matches; with high chance the match ends immediately, maximizing the immediate payoff is optimal.

Payoff reminders: mutual C = 3 each, mutual D = 1 each, I D / they C = 5 for me, I C / they D = 0 for me. In a near one-shot setting defect is the safe, dominant choice because cooperating risks the sucker payoff (0) while defect guarantees at least 1 and captures the temptation payoff (5) if the opponent cooperates.

Implications for strategy
- With such a short expected horizon, the dominant immediate incentive is to defect: D gets 1 guaranteed against an opponent who mostly defects, and potentially 5 when they stray C.

Some even defected after a few rounds of cooperation. There are also some opponents who will punish me for defecting.

Since I have no information about the current opponent, I should start with a strategy that is relatively safe and can adapt to the opponent's behavior. Tit-for-tat is a good starting point. It begins with cooperation and then mirrors the opponent's previous move. This encourages cooperation from cooperative opponents and punishes defection. However, I need to be careful about getting stuck in a D-D loop.

Given my history, many opponents defect when I start with C. I will start with D to probe their strategy. If the opponent cooperates, I will switch to Tit-for-Tat. If the opponent defects, I will continue to defect, but I'll re-evaluate after a few rounds.

- First round of this match; no prior moves between us and this opponent.
- The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round, so the continuation probability δ = 0.25. The future (“shadow of the future”) is weak.

Opponent strategy (unknown)
- I have no within-match history to infer this opponent’s rule. Across prior opponents I often opened with D and saw many varied responses (some cooperated, many defected). That population evidence is noisy and not decisive for a single unknown opponent.

Strategic reasoning
- In a repeated PD the standard sustainability condition for mutual cooperation (with grim trigger) is δ ≥ (T − R)/(T − P). Here T=5, R=3, P=1, so the threshold is (5−3)/(5−1) = 0.5. Our δ = 0.25 < 0.5, so cooperative strategies cannot be reliably sustained — retaliation is too weak to enforce cooperation.
- Looking at immediate payoffs in the first round: if the opponent cooperates with probability p, then
  - Expected payoff of Defect = 5p + 1(1−p) = 1 + 4p
  - Expected payoff of Cooperate = 3p + 0(1−p) = 3p
  Defect ≥ Cooperate for all p ≥ 0 (since 1 + 4p − 3p = 1 + p ≥ 1). So defection dominates on the immediate payoff.
- Because the continuation probability is low, the immediate payoff dominates expected total payoff, and potential future punishment is not a sufficient deterrent.

Decision
- Defect to maximize expected score in this first round (and given low δ, in subsequent rounds as well unless the opponent reveals a surprisingly forgiving strategy).

- We have a single prior encounter with Opponent_132 (Match 431): the outcome was (D, D) — opponent defected at least once against us.
- The continuation probability is very low (75% chance the match ends after a round → only 25% chance of continuation). So the effective game is very short on average; future retaliation or reward is unlikely to be an important incentive.

Implications about opponent strategy
- With only one data point the opponent could be AllD, a suspicious strategy that defects first, or a strategy that retaliates when met with defection. They are unlikely to be a strategy that reliably opens with cooperation (e.g., classic TFT) because they defected in the prior first/only round.
- Given the observed population behavior (many past matches show heavy defection), AllD or a defect-first policy is a plausible prior.

Strategic reasoning
- Payoffs: defecting dominates cooperating in the one-shot or very-short-horizon PD. If the opponent defects, cooperating gives us 0 vs defecting gives 1. If the opponent cooperates, defecting gives 5 vs cooperating gives 3. With a short expected continuation, the one-round gain from defecting is strongly favored.
- The opponent has already defected against us; cooperating now risks a 0 payoff if they defect again, while defecting guarantees at least 1. Potential future benefits from establishing cooperation are unlikely because of the high end probability.

Decision
- Play defect (D).

That gives very little reliable evidence of a forgiving pattern.

The match continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue each round; 75% to end), so the expected number of rounds is ≈1.33. With such a short expected horizon the future shadow is weak and the one-shot incentive dominates: defection strictly dominates cooperation in a single round (payoff D = 5 vs C = 3 if they cooperate, and D = 1 vs C = 0 if they defect).

Given limited opponent data and the short expected game, the payoff-maximizing action now is to defect.

- Continuation probability 0.75 → expected rounds ≈ 4, so per-round expected payoffs matter and there's some chance for future retaliation to matter but limited.

Opponent_132 behavior (from prior matches 431–433):
- Moves observed: D once, C twice (we played D in all three matches).
- Empirical first-move cooperation rate ≈ 2/3.
- Importantly, they did not retaliate after we defected in previous separate matches (they cooperated twice when we played D), so there is no strong evidence they are a strict retaliator like TFT or Grim.

Expected per-round payoffs (using empirical P(C)=2/3):
- If I defect: E[payoff] = (2/3)*5 + (1/3)*1 = 3.667
- If I cooperate: E[payoff] = (2/3)*3 + (1/3)*0 = 2.0

Decision reasoning:
- Defecting exploites the opponent's substantial tendency to cooperate and yields a much higher expected payoff per round.
- The risk that they will retaliate in future rounds appears low given past behavior; even if they sometimes defect, the expected value of defecting is clearly higher.
- Therefore the score-maximizing action is to defect.

The opponent (Opponent_132) has played C twice and D twice in four recent encounters with me: [(D,D), (D,C), (D,C), (D,D)]. I was the first mover each time and mostly defected; the opponent did not consistently retaliate — they cooperated on at least two occasions even after my defections.

Opponent's likely strategy: mixed/forgiving or noisy. Not a strict Tit‑for‑Tat retaliator (would have defected consistently after my Ds), and not a persistent cooperator either. With limited data they look like a roughly 50/50 cooperator but prone to forgive/exhibit noise.

Decision rationale: given the opponent’s apparent forgiveness and the payoff structure (D vs C = 5 for me, mutual C = 3, mutual D = 1), defecting has at least as high an expected payoff here and risks only mutual D (1) if they defect. Since they have shown willingness to cooperate after my defections, exploiting that while it appears safe gives a higher immediate expected return. I'll defect on the first move.

- The match is at its first round (no moves yet). The game has a 75% chance of ending after any round (continuation probability 25%), so the expected number of rounds is very small (~1.33). That makes the one-shot incentive to defect very strong — future reciprocation is unlikely to matter much.

- Opponent_132's recent behavior (across five recent matches) is mixed but leans toward defection: (D,D), (D,C), (D,C), (D,D), (D,D). They cooperated in 2 of 5 first rounds (40%); they defected in 60%. That marginal tendency to defect reduces the expected payoff from cooperating.

- Expected payoffs on this first move (using empirical P(C_opp) ≈ 0.4):
  - If I defect: 0.4*5 + 0.6*1 = 2.6 expected points.
  - If I cooperate: 0.4*3 + 0.6*0 = 1.2 expected points.
  Defection yields a clear advantage.

- My own history also favors defection-first; given the short expected horizon and opponent's tendency to defect, the payoff-maximizing choice is to defect.

- No moves yet this match.
- Continuation probability is low: each round has 75% chance of ending, so probability of continuing to next round is only 0.25 (expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds). Future rewards are heavily discounted.

Opponent's past behavior (Against me)
- In six recent encounters with Opponent_132 their moves were: D, C, C, D, D, C while I always played D.
- That suggests a mixed or forgiving/random strategy: they sometimes cooperate even after my defections, but not reliably.

Strategic reasoning
- With such a low continuation probability (δ = 0.25), the usual repeated-game incentives for sustaining cooperation fail (cooperation requires δ ≥ 0.5 under simple trigger strategies).
- In the one-shot (or effectively short) interaction defecting strictly dominates cooperating: defect payoff = 4q + 1, cooperate payoff = 3q (for opponent cooperation probability q), and defect ≥ cooperate for all q.
- Given my history of always defecting and the opponent’s inconsistent cooperation, I cannot count on stable mutual cooperation that would justify a cooperative move.
- Therefore the expected payoff-maximizing action in this match is to defect.

I'm playing Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

Looking at my match history, I've played many opponents. A significant portion of them initially cooperated (chose 'C'). However, a large number of them defected after my initial cooperation, and several continued to defect. Also, some opponents reacted to my defection with cooperation, making it hard to find a single strategy.

Since I have no information about my current opponent, I'll start with a cooperative move ('C'). This allows me to see how they respond. If they cooperate, I'll continue to cooperate. If they defect, I'll consider switching to a more tit-for-tat approach or even defection, depending on how the game plays out. Starting with cooperation is a good way to test the waters and potentially establish a mutually beneficial relationship.

- This is the first round of a new match against an unknown opponent. Past matches show a mix of opponents (many opened with C, many with D), so I have no reliable single-opponent pattern to bank on.
- The match is noisy-short: after each round there is a 75% chance the game ends, so the probability the game continues to a next round is only 25% (delta = 0.25). Expected number of rounds = 1/(1-0.25) = 1.333 — most matches are just one round, occasionally a second, rarely longer.
- Because the horizon is effectively very short, immediate payoffs dominate future considerations. The one-shot incentives strongly favor defection: D strictly dominates C for a single round (5 vs 3 if opponent C; 1 vs 0 if opponent D).

Decision tradeoffs (examples)
- If the opponent is a cooperative reciprocator (starts C and would keep cooperating), cooperating every round yields expected payoff 3/(1-0.25)=4.
- If I defect on the first move while they start C and then retaliate (TFT-like), my expected payoff is 5 + 0.25*1/(1-0.25) = 5 + 1/3 = 5.333 — higher than 4.
- If the opponent defects first, cooperating gives 0 immediately while defecting gives 1. Defection avoids the worst-case exploitation.

Conclusion
- With an unknown opponent, and given the very low continuation probability, the safe, payoff-maximizing best response is to defect on the first move.

D","Sorry—I can’t provide my detailed internal chain-of-thought. I can give a brief, non-sensitive summary of my reasoning and then my move.

Summary:
- The match is effectively short: there’s a 75% chance the game ends after each round, so the continuation probability is only 0.25 (expected rounds ≈ 1.33). That makes future retaliation or reward unlikely to change the optimal first-round choice.
- In a one-shot or near one-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma, Defect is the dominant action to maximize expected points against an unknown opponent.
- The historical record shows many opponents in past matches cooperated often enough to be exploitable, so there's non-negligible chance cooperating would be reciprocated — but given the low continuation probability and the high immediate payoff for defecting (5 vs 3/0), defect remains the safer expected-value-maximizing choice.

The continuation probability is low — after each round there's a 75% chance the match ends, so the chance of continuing to another round is only 25% (expected remaining rounds is small).

Opponent inference:
- They defected in the first round. That rules out many pure “cooperate-first” strategies (e.g. orthodox Tit‑for‑Tat that opens with C) and is consistent with ALLD, suspicious/TFT variants, or other defect‑heavy rules.
- Even if they are a conditional cooperator (TFT, Pavlov, grudger), many of those respond to our previous D by playing D this round. Because moves are simultaneous, their round‑2 choice will likely be D if they base it on our D.
- Given the tournament history overall, defecting is common in the population; expecting reliable, repeated mutual cooperation here is risky.

Payoff reasoning:
- If they play D this round, my payoff is 1 if I play D vs 0 if I play C — defect strictly dominates in that case.
- Trying to “signal” cooperation by playing C risks giving the opponent 5 points now if they continue D; with such a low continuation probability, the expected future reward from attempting to rebuild cooperation is small and doesn’t compensate for the immediate exploitation risk.

Decision: defect is the safe, payoff‑maximizing choice given their initial D and the low chance of substantial future interaction.

D","State: after one round we have mutual defection (D,D). The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round, so continuation probability δ = 0.25. That implies an expected total number of rounds ≈ 1.33 (very short), so immediate payoffs dominate future considerations.

Inference about opponent: a first-round D is consistent with an always-defect or a non-cooperative opener (grim, defect-first, or opportunistic). Given only one data point, I can’t be certain they’re permanently hostile, but the safe inference is that they are at least willing to defect immediately and may continue to do so.

Strategic reasoning: with such a high termination chance the value of building cooperation for future rounds is small. Immediate payoffs matter most: if I cooperate and they defect I get 0 (bad), if I defect and they defect I get 1 (better in the short run); cooperating now risks being exploited for little expected future gain. Also, given they already defected, there is little credible signal advantage in switching to C — it’s likely to be exploited or ignored.

Decision: defect to avoid exploitation and maximize my expected score given the short horizon and their opening D.

Opponent model: unknown — could be cooperator (starts C/TFT-like), exploiter, or defector. From the tournament history many opponents sometimes cooperate initially, but many also defect; there is no reliable identifier yet.

Game-theory analysis:
- Single-shot PD: Defect strictly dominates Cooperate (D gives 5 vs 3 if they C, and 1 vs 0 if they D).
- This is an iterated game but the continuation probability is low: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the continuation probability δ = 0.25. Expected number of rounds ≈ 1/(1−δ) = 1/0.75 ≈ 1.33 — so the interaction is typically very short and the immediate round is heavily weighted.
- Compare simple strategies assuming an opponent that starts C and then retaliates (TFT-like): always cooperating yields total payoff 3/(1−δ) = 3/0.75 = 4. If I instead defect in the first round (get 5) and then mutual defection follows, payoff ≈ 5 + δ·(1/(1−δ))·1 = 5 + δ/(1−δ) = 5 + 0.25/0.75 ≈ 5.333. With δ this small, the one-shot temptation dominates; defecting first yields higher expected return even against conditional cooperators.
- Defection is also robust against pure defectors (1 vs 0) and exploiters.

Decision: with no information and a short expected horizon, the payoff-maximizing, risk-robust first move is Defect.

D","Reasoning:
- History with Opponent_134 (Match 439): two rounds, both (D,D). That strongly suggests they either always defect or at least defect on the first move and punish defection. They did not show initial cooperation in that encounter.
- The continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue each round, i.e. 75% chance the game ends). Expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds. With such a short expected horizon, there is little opportunity to build long-run cooperation; immediate payoffs dominate.
- Payoff incentives: if opponent defects, cooperating yields 0 (very bad) while defecting yields 1. If opponent would cooperate, defecting yields 5 (best immediate payoff). Given the opponent’s prior mutual defection and the short expected horizon, defecting is the safe, payoff-maximizing choice.

The continuation probability is low (only 0.25 chance of another round), so the effective shadow of the future is weak — establishing long-run cooperation is unlikely to be worth a one-time sacrifice.

Opponent model: with only one round observed and mutual defection, plausible hypotheses include Always-Defect or a retaliatory rule (e.g. Tit‑for‑Tat / grim) that will also defect next. My long history shows many opponents who either cooperate once and get exploited or simply defect repeatedly; given the mutual D, the safest assumption is non-cooperation going forward.

Strategy/expectation: in a single round defect strictly dominates cooperate. For the repeated game, cooperation can be supported only if the discount/continuation probability δ ≥ 0.5 (in the grim-trigger incentive calculation). Here δ = 0.25, well below that threshold, so future cooperation is not credible enough to offset the immediate gain from defection. Also, if the opponent will continue to defect (likely given the opening), cooperating risks getting 0 instead of 1.

Decision: defect to avoid exploitation and to maximize expected payoff given the short expected horizon and the observed mutual defection.

D","Game state and opponent behavior:
- In this match we’ve already played one round: (D, D).
- In your prior encounter with Opponent_134 (Match 439) the sequence was (D, D), (D, D) — they defected every round in that match.
- That pattern plus the current D on their first move is strong evidence they are AllD or at least overwhelmingly defect-prone.

Strategic reasoning:
- The continuation probability is only 0.25 (75% chance the game ends after each round). With such a low shadow of the future, the incentive to sustain cooperation is very weak — one-shot or short-horizon incentives dominate.
- If the opponent is AllD, cooperating now would be exploited (0 vs 5), whereas defection guarantees at least 1 point instead of risking 0.
- Even if the opponent were a grudger or a noisy cooperator, the historical record and the immediate move make cooperation unlikely to be reliably reciprocated here.
- Given the evidence and the low continuation probability, the payoff-maximizing, risk-averse choice is to defect.

The environment is highly myopic: after each round there is a 75% chance the match ends (continuation probability δ = 0.25). That makes future rounds relatively unlikely, so immediate payoff carries heavy weight.

Opponent inference from past matches: my archive shows lots of opponents who cooperated on early moves (many (D,C) entries where I defected while they cooperated), but also a large mass of opponents who consistently defect. The population is mixed and I have no identifying information about this particular opponent, so I must act based on expected payoff rather than on trusting reciprocity.

Payoff comparison (single-round perspective): if opponent cooperates with probability p,
- Expected payoff if I play C = 3p
- Expected payoff if I play D = 1 + 4p
Since 1 + 4p > 3p for all p ∈ [0,1], defecting strictly dominates for the current round absent reliable future benefits.

Future-benefit consideration: cooperation can pay off only if it meaningfully increases future cooperation from the opponent. With δ = 0.25 the discounted value of future rounds is small, so the threshold probability that cooperating today leads to sustained extra cooperation is unrealistic given no prior signals. My historical data shows many opponents are exploitable, but too many others are permanent defectors; the risk of being suckered (0 instead of 5) on a round that is likely the last outweighs the modest chance of building a multi-round mutual cooperation given the high termination chance.

Decision: defect to maximize expected points on this very likely final/short interaction.

D","Observations
- Opponent_134 has appeared twice in your history (Match 439 and Match 441). In every recorded round vs them the opponent played D (the tuples are (You, Opponent) and every opponent entry is D).
- That pattern (D every time across matches) strongly suggests Opponent_134 is an unconditional defector (ALLD) or at least defects on first contact and never reciprocates.

Game-structure considerations
- The match has a very short expected length: there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round (continuation probability 25%), so the expected number of rounds is 1/(1−0.25)=1.333... rounds. Most matches will be one round, and there’s limited opportunity to build cooperation.
- Against an opponent who defects reliably, cooperation yields 0 in the round(s) they defect; defection yields 1 (both-defect payoff). There’s no profitable short-run incentive to try to entice cooperation given the opponent’s observed behavior and the low chance of additional rounds.

Decision
- Given the consistent evidence of defection and the short expected horizon, defecting is payoff-dominant. I'll defect.

- This is the first round of the current match (no prior moves).
- The match is very short on average: there is a 75% chance the game ends after any round, so the continuation probability δ = 0.25 and expected number of rounds ≈ 1/(1−δ) = 1.333. The first round dominates expected payoff.

Opponent strategy (uncertain)
- Opponent identity is unknown. Across past matches I faced a mix: many opponents cooperated at first then were exploited, and many were persistent defectors. There is no reliable signal before the first move.

Decision reasoning
- With such a low continuation probability the interaction is essentially a one-shot game. Let p be the opponent's probability of cooperating this first round.
  - Expected payoff if I defect: 5p + 1(1−p) = 1 + 4p.
  - Expected payoff if I cooperate: 3p + 0(1−p) = 3p.
  - Difference = (1 + 4p) − 3p = 1 + p > 0 for all p ≥ 0. So defecting strictly dominates cooperating for the first round.
- Historical behavior also supports defection as a safe default: many opponents defected or punished cooperation, and with such a short expected horizon trying to induce future cooperation rarely compensates.

Move
D","Game state and evidence: In three recent matches (Matches 439, 441, 443) Opponent_134 defected in every recorded round (two rounds, two rounds, one round — all D). Across those encounters I also played D each time. That is strong evidence the opponent is an All‑D or at least a consistently defecting strategy.

Strategic implications: The stage game payoff favors defecting against a defector (1 point for mutual D vs 0 if I unilaterally cooperate). The continuation probability is low (25% chance to continue each round), so the effective horizon is short (expected ~1.33 rounds), reducing the value of any attempt to “train” the opponent into cooperation. Given the observed behavior and the short expected future, the safe, payoff‑maximizing action is to defect.

- We have only one completed round: (D, D). Both defected to start.
- The game is very short on average: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so expected total rounds ≈ 1/0.75 = 1.33 rounds. That makes immediate payoffs much more important than long-run cooperation.

What the opponent's move suggests
- A first-round D by the opponent is consistent with several plausible strategies: an always-defect policy, Tit‑for‑Tat (or other retaliatory/mirroring strategies that punish a partner's D), or a strategy that defects initially.
- With only one round observed, we have little to distinguish these; the safest inference is that the opponent is at least willing to defect and likely to defect next if they retaliate.

Payoff tradeoffs for the next round
- If I play D: payoff is 1 (if opponent defects) or 5 (if they unexpectedly cooperate).
- If I play C: payoff is 0 (if opponent defects) or 3 (if they cooperate).
- Given the opponent likely to defect next (mirroring or always‑defect) and the short expected remaining interaction, defecting dominates: D yields 1 guaranteed (or likely), while C risks 0 with little chance to recoup through future cooperation.

Decision
- Play D.

D","Opponent_134's past behavior: across three prior encounters (Matches 439, 441, 443) every recorded round was (D,D) — they defected each time we saw them. In the current match the first round was also (D,D). There are no instances where they cooperated or where they responded to our cooperation, so all available evidence points to a persistent defecting strategy (most likely Always-Defect or an unforgiving defector).

Payoff reasoning: if they continue to defect, my best response is defect (1 point vs 0 if I cooperate while they defect). The continuation probability is low (only 25% chance to continue each round), so the game is effectively short — attempts to “test” cooperation are unlikely to pay off enough to offset the immediate loss from cooperating against a defector.

- New match, no prior moves.
- Continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the match ends after any round). Expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds, so the vast majority of value is in the first move.

Opponent strategy (uncertain)
- Unknown opponent; could be anything (always-C, always-D, TFT, Tit-for-Tat variants, grudger, etc.).
- From the tournament history many opponents have cooperated at least initially (we have many (D,C) entries), so there’s a reasonable chance the opponent may cooperate on round 1. But many opponents also defect a lot; overall the pool is mixed.

Decision reasoning
- In a single-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma defection is the dominant action (5>3 if opponent cooperates, and 1>0 if opponent defects).
- With continuation probability only 0.25, the expected value of future retaliation or reciprocation is small, so the short-run incentive to defect on the first move dominates.
- Even if the opponent is a forgiving/reciprocal strategy (e.g., TFT), the small chance of future rounds makes the expected cost of being punished low relative to the immediate gain from exploiting a cooperative opener.
- Given uncertainty and the high probability the match ends after the first round, the expected payoff-maximizing move is to defect.

D","Opponent_134's past behavior in our encounters is very consistent: across four recent matches (total 7 rounds) they played D every time and never cooperated. In at least one match they opened with D (single-round match), and in the multi-round matches they continued defecting. That pattern strongly indicates an AllD or a strategy that defects immediately and persistently.

Given the payoff structure:
- If they always defect, my best response is D (1 point per round) rather than C (0).
- There's little chance to induce cooperation later: they historically never responded cooperatively even when interaction continued, and the match has a high 75% chance of ending after each round, so opportunities for long-term reciprocity are scarce.

Thus the payoff-maximizing, risk-minimizing choice here is to defect.

The continuation probability after each round is low: 75% chance of ending each round means only δ = 0.25 chance of another round. So the future is heavily discounted.

What the past data suggests about opponents: across hundreds of past matches the population is heavily defect-prone or retaliatory. There are many sequences of mutual D and many cases where my defection met with C (naive cooperators) or later D (retaliators). There is little evidence the population reliably sustains long runs of mutual cooperation.

Strategic reasoning and payoff math:
- One-shot incentives: defecting this round against a cooperator gives 5 vs cooperating gives 3; defect strictly dominates in a single round.
- With δ = 0.25, the infinite-horizon cooperative stream payoff (if both cooperate forever) for cooperating now is 3/(1−δ) = 3/0.75 = 4 expected points.
- If I defect now and then (plausibly) go to mutual defection thereafter, I get 5 immediately + expected continuation ≈ δ * 1/(1−δ) = 0.333..., so ≈ 5.333 total — higher than 4 even under optimistic assumptions about future cooperation.
- Given low δ and a population that often defects, the risk-adjusted best response is to defect now to secure the higher immediate payoff and avoid being exploited by defectors.

Decision: Defect.

D","Opponent_134's past behavior in our previous encounters is unambiguous: every recorded round shows them defecting. Specifically, across Matches 439, 441, 443, 445 and 447 their moves were D in every round (all outcomes with me were (D,D) or (D,D),(D,D) — i.e., they never cooperated). That strongly indicates an AllD (or effectively always-defecting) strategy.

Given that:
- They have never shown willingness to cooperate in many repeated matches, so a one-off cooperative probe is very unlikely to induce reciprocal cooperation.
- The stage game payoff makes cooperation exploitable (0 vs their D), while mutual defection (1 each) is safer.
- The continuation probability is high (0.75), so if they were conditional cooperators it could pay to try to build trust — but their persistent defection history makes that prospect negligible.

Best-response against a defector is to defect to avoid being exploited and to secure the 1 point per round rather than risking 0.

- This is the first round of a very short match: there is a 75% chance the match ends after each round (continuation probability δ = 0.25). Expected total rounds ≈ 1.33, so future punishment/reward carries little weight.
- Opponent identity/strategy is unknown. From the tournament history I’ve seen many opponents defect frequently or allow me to exploit a cooperation; many matches end in mutual defection. That increases the prior probability the opponent will defect or fail to sustain cooperation.

Payoff reasoning
- Immediate payoffs this round: if I play D I get 5 vs C-opponent and 1 vs D-opponent; if I play C I get 3 vs C-opponent and 0 vs D-opponent.
- Because δ is only 0.25, the expected value of future cooperative returns is small (expected remaining rounds after this one ≈ 0.333). Even against a reciprocating strategy, the marginal future gain from starting with C is too small to compensate the immediate 2-point loss relative to defecting when opponent would have cooperated now.
- Given the population tendency toward defection and the short horizon, the safe myopic-maximizing action is to defect.

Opponent model
- Could be cooperator, tit-for-tat, or defector. Even if it’s TFT or a generous cooperator, the small continuation probability gives little expected benefit to a one-time cooperative signal; against an unconditional cooperator D is strictly better this round; against a defector C is strictly worse this round.

Decision
- Defect this first round to maximize expected score given the short match length and the observed population behavior.

D","Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, and I have a long history of previous matches. The key to success in this game is to identify the opponent's strategy and adapt accordingly.

Based on my match history, I've encountered a wide variety of opponents:

*   **Cooperators:** Many opponents have cooperated in the first round (or even multiple rounds).
*   **Defectors:** A significant number of opponents have defected in the first round.
*   **Tit-for-Tat:** Some opponents seem to be playing Tit-for-Tat, mirroring my previous move.
*   **Always Defect:** A few opponents have consistently defected.
*   **Random:** Some might be playing randomly.

In this current match, I have no information about my opponent yet. Given the high probability (75%) of the game ending after each round, a purely exploitative strategy might be too risky. A safe approach is to start with cooperation and observe the opponent's response. If they cooperate, I'll continue to cooperate. If they defect, I might consider defecting in the next round to avoid being exploited, but I'll also need to consider the possibility that they're playing Tit-for-Tat.

Therefore, my initial move will be to cooperate.

- No moves yet in this match. Continuation probability is low (75% chance of ending after each round → only 25% chance to continue), so the expected match length is short (~1.33 rounds). That makes the interaction close to a one-shot game rather than a long shadowed game.

Opponent history
- In phase 5 we met Opponent_135 (Match 440) and the sequence was (D,D), (D,D): they defected every observed round. There are no other encounters to suggest any cooperation or probabilistic forgiveness.

Inference about opponent strategy
- The simplest consistent explanation is that Opponent_135 is an always-defect or highly defect-prone strategy. Given the short expected horizon, even if they were a conditional cooperator, the incentive to attempt to build cooperation is low.

Decision reasoning
- If opponent defects, cooperating yields 0 (worse) while defecting yields 1 (better). Mutual defection (1,1) is safer than risking 0 by cooperating against a defector. With prior evidence of persistent defection and a short expected match, defecting maximizes expected points.

D","Game state
- This is the first round of the current match (history empty).
- The game is almost one-shot: after each round there is a 75% chance the match ends (so continuation probability ≈ 25%). Expected number of rounds is ~1.33 — long-term incentives are weak.

Opponent behavior
- We faced Opponent_133 previously (Match 438) and the recorded rounds were (D,D), (D,D). In that encounter the opponent defected every round.
- With only that data, the safest inference is that Opponent_133 is at best non-cooperative (likely All‑D or at least defects immediately and persistently).

Strategic reasoning
- In a short expected game, the one-shot temptation to defect (5 vs 3 if the other cooperates) dominates; cooperating risks getting 0 if the opponent defects.
- Given prior evidence that Opponent_133 defected every round, cooperating here is likely to be exploited.
- Even if Opponent_133 were a conditional cooperator (e.g., TFT), the low continuation probability reduces the value of trying to establish cooperation.

Decision
- Defect to maximize expected payoff against an opponent who has shown persistent defection and given the near one-shot nature of the match.

- Continuation probability is low: after any round there is a 75% chance the match ends, i.e. only a 25% chance to play another round. Expected total rounds ≈ 1.33 (short shadow of the future), so the immediate move has high weight.

What I know about this opponent
- The only prior encounter with Opponent_136 (Match 442) shows a single round of (D,D). That is one data point, but it does indicate they defected when we met.
- With a single observation the opponent’s strategy is uncertain (could be an always-defector, a retaliatory strategy, or noise), but the observed behavior leans toward defection.
- In the tournament as a whole many opponents defect frequently, so cautious play is warranted.

Payoff reasoning
- If I cooperate and they defect I get 0 (worst immediate outcome). If I defect and they defect I get 1 (better than 0). If they are actually cooperative and I defect I get 5 (best), but given the prior D and short horizon the risk of being exploited by cooperating is not justified.
- Because the future is unlikely and the opponent previously defected, the safe, payoff-maximizing choice is to defect to avoid a 0 payoff.

Decision
D","Game state
- No moves yet in the current match.
- The match history shows two prior encounters with Opponent_133: Match 438 = [(D,D), (D,D)] and Match 452 = [(D,D)]. In all prior rounds against this opponent, they defected.

Opponent strategy inference
- Opponent_133 appears to be a pure defector (AllD) or at least extremely defect-prone: they never cooperated in our previous encounters.
- Given that behavior, cooperating now would be exploited (0 for me vs 5 for them). Defecting guarantees at least the mutual-defect payoff (1) and gives the temptation payoff (5) if they ever unexpectedly cooperate.

Game-theoretic context
- The continuation structure is unfavorable to long-run cooperation: there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round (low continuation probability), so future retaliation/reward has little expected value. That reduces the incentive to try to establish cooperation.

Decision
- Best-response given evidence and short expected horizon: defect.

The only data about this opponent is our previous meeting (Match 444): two rounds, both (D,D). So the opponent defected on the first round and continued defecting.

Opponent model: With only that small sample, the opponent could be an Always-Defect or a strategy that starts with D (or simply responded to our D with D). The safest estimate is that they are non-cooperative / defect-prone.

Strategic environment: The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability δ = 0.25). That makes future punishment/reward much less effective — the game is close to a one-shot, so the immediate payoff dominates decisions.

Payoff implications:
- If opponent defects, my choices yield: C → 0, D → 1. Defection strictly beats cooperation when opponent defects.
- If opponent cooperates, my choices yield: C → 3, D → 5. One-shot incentive is to defect even against cooperators.
- Because δ is low, the future benefit of building cooperation is small; defecting now usually gives equal or higher expected payoff.

Decision: given the opponent’s prior two-round (D,D) behavior, the heavy prevalence of defection in past matches, and the low continuation probability, defecting is the best-risk-adjusted move.

D","Reasoning:
- History with Opponent_133: three previous encounters (Match 438, 452, 454) all ended in (D,D). No observed cooperation from them at any point.
- Likely strategy: Opponent_133 appears to be an always-defect (ALLD) or at least extremely unforgiving/defective from the first move.
- Game length: high termination probability (75% chance of ending after each round) => expected match length ≈1.33 rounds. With such a short expected horizon, the benefit of attempting cooperation is small and unlikely to be repaid.
- Payoff calculus: cooperating while an ALLD opponent defects yields 0 this round (worst outcome). Mutual defection gives 1, mutual cooperation 3 but is unattainable here given opponent's past behavior. Given opponent's consistent defection and short expected interaction, defecting maximizes expected score.

- This opponent was met once before (Match 446) and the outcome was (D,D) — they defected against me.
- The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (only 25% to continue), so the first round dominates expected payoff — it's essentially a near one-shot decision.

Opponent strategy inference
- With only one prior encounter, I can't reliably distinguish among strategies, but the prior D is consistent with an always-defect or a non-forgiving strategy.
- Even if they were cooperative sometimes, the high termination probability means there's little opportunity to build a long-term cooperative relationship.

Decision reasoning (game-theoretic)
- In a single-shot Prisoner’s Dilemma defection strictly dominates cooperation: if the opponent cooperates with probability p then
  - Expected payoff of D = 5p + 1(1−p) = 1 + 4p
  - Expected payoff of C = 3p + 0(1−p) = 3p
  - D is better whenever 1 + 4p > 3p, i.e. 1 + p > 0, which holds for all p ≥ 0.
- Given the prior (D) by this opponent and the near one-shot nature of the match, cooperating is exploitable and offers no reliable future benefit.

Choice
D","Game state: first round of this match (no moves yet). The environment has a 25% continuation probability (75% chance the match ends after each round), so the expected number of rounds is short (~1.33 rounds), meaning immediate payoffs dominate.

Opponent history: in four recent matches with Opponent_133 (Matches 438, 452, 454, 456) the opponent defected every round we saw: their moves are consistently D. That pattern strongly indicates an AllD or very persistent defecting strategy.

Decision reasoning: given the opponent appears to always defect, cooperating this round yields 0 (if they defect) while defecting yields 1 (both D). With the short expected horizon, there's little future benefit from attempting to induce cooperation. Defection strictly dominates given the evidence.

- Only one round has been played so far: (D,D).
- The match is very short on average: there's a 75% chance the game ends after each round, so the expected number of additional rounds after this one is only 0.25/0.75 ≈ 0.33. Immediate round payoffs dominate expected future gains.

What the opponent likely is doing
- My only observation of Opponent_138 (Match 446) is that they defected in the first/only round. That suggests they either start with defection (All-D, defect-first TFT, or an unforgiving strategy) or at least are not reliably cooperative.
- Given that single D and the low continuation probability, I should assume they will defect next round with substantial probability (TFT-like response to my previous D or simply All-D).

Payoff comparison for the next round
- If I cooperate and they defect: I get 0, they get 5 — worst outcome for me.
- If I defect and they defect: I get 1, they get 1.
- If they (unexpectedly) cooperate, defecting yields 5 vs cooperating yields 3 — defect still better.
- Under uncertainty about their next move, defection strictly dominates cooperating for this round (higher payoff against every plausible opponent action).

Decision
- Given the opponent's prior D, the high risk of being exploited by C, and the low expected number of future rounds, the utility-maximizing choice is to defect.

D","Game state
- First round ended (D,D). Opponent defected.
- There is a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the expected future (continuation) weight is small (continuation probability ≈ 0.25 per round). That makes short-term rewards more important.

Opponent model
- In four prior encounters (and multiple matches in Phase 5) Opponent_133 always played D (all recorded rounds against them are D or D,D). There is no evidence they respond to cooperation or forgive — their behavior is consistent with AllD (always defect) or a highly punitive fixed defection strategy.

Strategic reasoning
- Against an AllD-type opponent, cooperating yields 0 this round if they keep defecting, while defecting yields 1. With a low continuation probability, attempts to convert them to mutual cooperation are costly (you take the sucker payoff now) and unlikely to be recouped by many future cooperative rounds.
- Dominant safe best response given the history and low continuation weight is to defect: it maximizes immediate payoff and avoids being exploited.

Opponent model:
- Opponent_138 defected every time we've seen them (Match 446: (D,D); current match: two D's). That strongly suggests an always-defect or at least a persistent-defect strategy, not a reciprocating/cooperative one.

Strategic reasoning:
- Against a likely-all-D opponent, cooperating risks 0 (sucker payoff) while defecting guarantees 1 (mutual D). With very low expected future interaction, there is little long-run incentive to attempt to “teach” or entice cooperation.
- Given observed behavior and payoffs, defecting maximizes expected score.

Decision:
D","State and recent history
- In this match we've played two rounds and both rounds were (D,D).
- Across many previous matches with Opponent_133 they have repeatedly defected (lots of (D,D) outcomes). There is no evidence they've ever cooperated with me.

Opponent model
- Opponent_133 behaves like an always-defect (ALLD) or at least a very persistent defector. Given the long history of defections, the best explanation is they will defect next round with very high probability.

Game-theoretic considerations
- The continuation probability each round is 0.25 (75% chance the game ends after a round → 25% chance it continues). For these payoffs (T=5, R=3, P=1, S=0) the standard cooperation sustainability condition is delta ≥ (T−R)/(T−P) = (5−3)/(5−1) = 0.5. Our delta = 0.25 < 0.5, so the shadow of the future is too small to make unilateral cooperation profitable against a defector.
- If the opponent will defect, my best response this round is defect: D gives P=1 (mutual defection) rather than C which gives S=0 (sucker's payoff). With negligible chance of inducing cooperation and a short expected future, there is no incentive to switch to C.

Decision
- Defect.

- No moves yet in the current match.
- After each round there is a 75% chance the match ends, so continuation probability q = 0.25. Expected total rounds from the start is 1/(1−q) = 1.333…, so the future is very short — immediate payoff dominates.

Opponent signal
- We faced Opponent_139 once before (Match 448) and they defected in that round (history: (D,D)). That single sample suggests a tendency to defect at least initially.
- In the population history many opponents are defect-heavy; there is no strong signal that this opponent will open cooperatively or forgive long enough to make sustained cooperation likely given the low continuation probability.

Strategic reasoning
- Payoffs per round: mutual C = 3 each, mutual D = 1 each, you D / them C = 5 to you, you C / them D = 0 to you.
- In the first round, regardless of beliefs about their first move, defecting weakly dominates cooperating: if they cooperate, D yields 5 vs 3 for C; if they defect, D yields 1 vs 0 for C. Given the very low continuation probability (q = 0.25), the expected benefit of trying to establish cooperation in future rounds is small relative to the one-shot gain from defecting now.
- The prior encounter where Opponent_139 defected reinforces the cautious choice.

Decision
- Defect.

D","Opponent_133's past behavior: in every prior match recorded (matches 438, 452, 454, 456, 458) they defected every round — all rounds are (D,D). That is strong evidence they play Always Defect (or an invariant defecting strategy).

Game horizon: there's a 75% chance the match ends after each round, so the expected match length is short (~1.33 rounds). That makes getting the best immediate payoff especially important and reduces the value of attempts to establish multi-round cooperation.

Best-response reasoning: against an opponent who defects on the first move, cooperating gives 0 while defecting gives 5 in that round; with the short expected horizon the one-shot incentive to defect dominates. Given the consistent All-D history, there's essentially no prospect of reciprocal cooperation to offset the immediate exploitation risk.

Decision: defect on the first move.

- We only have one prior encounter with Opponent_139 (Match 448) and it was (D,D). In the current match we are 1 round in with (D,D). So the opponent has shown no cooperative signal.
- With essentially zero data, plausible opponent strategies include AllD, Tit‑for‑Tat (TFT), or other defect‑inclined rules. TFT would currently play D (it copies our previous D), so cooperating now would be immediately exploited.
- The game stops with 75% probability after each round, so the continuation probability is only 25% (delta = 0.25). That is below the usual threshold for sustaining cooperation (delta >= 0.5 for temptation/profile here), so long‑run cooperative gains are unlikely to justify a costly one‑shot concession.

Numeric intuition
- If I defect now while they defect, I get 1 immediately. If I unilaterally cooperate now and they defect (likely), I get 0 now (loss of 1 point).
- Even in the optimistic case where my cooperation induces mutual cooperation starting in round 3 (e.g. TFT-like opponent), the expected gain from future mutual C versus mutual D is small because continuation is unlikely:
  - Probability to reach round 3 = 0.25.
  - Expected number of rounds from round 3 onward given continuation parameter = 1/(1-0.25) = 4/3.
  - Benefit per future round switching D→C (mutual C vs mutual D) = 3−1 = 2.
  - Expected future benefit ≈ 0.25 * (4/3) * 2 ≈ 0.667.
- Immediate one‑round loss (-1) from being exploited now outweighs the expected future benefit (~+0.667), so switching to C is net-negative in expectation even under optimistic assumptions.

Decision
Given the prior (D,D), the opponent’s unknown but noncooperative behavior so far, and the very low continuation probability, the safe expected‑value maximizing play is to defect.

D","Game state
- We’ve just had one round in this match: (D,D).
- The per-round continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the match ends), so the game is very short on average. That makes future reward prospects small.

Opponent behavior
- In our many past encounters with Opponent_133 they always defected: previous matches show only (D,D) outcomes (multiple matches with one or more rounds, all D by them).
- Given that consistent history, the best model is that Opponent_133 is an All-Defect (always-defect) player or at least extremely unlikely to cooperate.

Decision reasoning
- If the opponent will defect, cooperating gives 0 this round while defecting gives 1 — defect strictly dominates.
- With such a low continuation probability, trying to “forgive” or attempt to induce cooperation has negligible expected benefit.
- Therefore the payoff-maximizing action now is to defect.

- This is the first round of the current match; last time I met Opponent_140 (Match 450) they played C while I played D — only one data point.
- The per-round end probability is 75%, so the match is short. The continuation probability q = 0.25, giving expected rounds ≈ 1/(1−q) = 1.33 rounds.

What the opponent might be
- With only one previous interaction (they played C), plausible hypotheses: unconditional cooperator, a nice strategy (TFT-like) that starts C, or a single-shot cooperator. There’s no evidence they punish heavily over many rounds.
- Even if they are Tit-for-Tat/grim, the low continuation probability makes future retaliation fairly unlikely to change the immediate optimal play.

Decision reasoning (expected-payoff intuition)
- If I defect now while they play C this round: immediate payoff = 5. Expected payoff including a possible next round (prob q = 0.25):
  - vs TFT: 5 (now) + q*1 (next round both D) = 5 + 0.25 = 5.25
  - vs always-C: 5 + q*5 = 5 + 1.25 = 6.25
- If I cooperate now (both C): immediate 3, future expected:
  - vs TFT or always-C: 3 + q*3 = 3 + 0.75 = 3.75
- Defection gives a higher expected return under plausible opponent types given the short expected match length.

Choice
D","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

**Overall Strategy:**

Given the large number of past matches, and the fact that many opponents defected after my initial cooperation, a purely tit-for-tat strategy might not be optimal in this environment. A more nuanced approach is needed. I'll start with cooperation, but be ready to defect if the opponent does. I will also consider the overall history to identify potentially exploitable opponents.

**Opponent Analysis:**

I have no information about the current opponent other than the history is empty.  I need to start with a reasonable assumption. Given the high percentage of opponents who defected after initial cooperation in my history, I should be cautious, but I'll start by cooperating to see what they do.

**Reasoning:**

1.  **First Move:** In the first round, I have no information. The best initial strategy is generally to cooperate to signal willingness to cooperate and see if the opponent reciprocates.
2.  **Risk Mitigation:** Starting with cooperation carries the risk of being exploited for 5 points if the opponent defects. However, the long-term potential gains from mutual cooperation outweigh this initial risk, especially given the 75% chance of the game ending each round.

**Decision:**

- Past encounters with Opponent_136: Match 442 = (D,D), Match 453 = (D,D). In both previous matches they defected and I defected as well.
- No history of them cooperating with me, so the best inference is they play All‑D or at least defect on opening moves.

Game-theoretic reasoning
- Payoffs: C/C = 3 each, D/D = 1 each, C versus D gives 0 to me, 5 to them.
- The match is short on expectation (75% chance the match ends after each round → only ~1.33 rounds expected). With such a high chance of termination, there is little future to reward initial cooperation.
- Given their past behavior (always defect) and the short effective horizon, cooperating risks 0 points while defecting guarantees at least 1 point if they defect.
- Even if there is some small probability they might cooperate, the expected gain from risking C (potential 3 if they also cooperate) is outweighed by the repeated evidence of defection and the low chance of extending the game to “punish/reward” patterns.

Decision
- Play defect to avoid being exploited and to maximize expected payoff against this opponent.

- The match is very likely to be short: after each round there is a 75% chance the match ends, so the probability the game continues is only 25% (very weak future incentive to build cooperation).
- Past history with Opponent_135: Match 440 = (D,D), (D,D); Match 451 = (D,D). Every observed round was mutual defection — no sign of cooperation or forgivable errors from them.

Opponent model
- Most plausible model given the data: Opponent_135 is an unconditional defector or at least defects reliably on the first rounds and does not reciprocate cooperation. Even if they were a more complex strategy, the strong and repeated D evidence plus the high chance of termination makes trusting them risky.

Decision logic
- If the opponent defects this round, my payoff: D -> 1, C -> 0. So defect strictly dominates against a defector.
- The expected benefit of cooperating to try to trigger future mutual cooperation is minimal because continuation probability is only 0.25 and opponent has not shown cooperative responses in history.
- Therefore the safe, payoff-maximizing action against this opponent and in this short-horizon environment is to defect.

- Only one round has played in this match so far: (D,D) — mutual defection.
- The match termination rule is strongly in favor of ending: after each round there is a 75% chance the match stops, so the continuation probability is only 25%. Future rounds are therefore unlikely and heavily discounted.

Opponent model
- In this tournament history Opponent_136 has previously only produced (D,D) encounters with me (Match 442 and Match 453), i.e. they defected in those interactions and gave no signal of being willing to cooperate.
- Given the current (D,D) and the prior encounters, the simplest and most consistent hypothesis is that Opponent_136 is an unconditional defector (or a very stubborn defector). There is no evidence they will switch to cooperating in future rounds.

Decision reasoning
- Given the opponent’s apparent strategy (always-defect) cooperating now risks 0 points (if they defect) while defecting guarantees at least 1 point now.
- The low continuation probability (25%) means any potential long-run gains from attempting to establish cooperation are small and unlikely to materialize; the expected benefit of trying to “forgive” is outweighed by the sure short-term loss.
- Against an apparent unconditional defector, the payoff-maximizing action in this environment is to defect.

My move
D","Game state
- We've already played one round this match: (D,D).
- The match is very likely to end after any round (75% chance of ending each round), so future rounds are unlikely; immediate payoff matters most.

Opponent's strategy (inferred)
- In previous encounters with Opponent_135 (Match 440: (D,D),(D,D); Match 451: (D,D)) the opponent always defected.
- In the current match they defected on the first move. Taken together, the evidence strongly indicates Opponent_135 is an AllD (always-defect) or at least highly biased toward defection.

Decision reasoning
- Against an AllD opponent, cooperating now would give me 0 while they get 5 (large one-shot loss). Mutual defection gives 1 each.
- Given the high termination probability, the expected benefit of attempting to establish cooperation is small; the safe, payoff-maximizing choice against a persistent defector is to defect to avoid exploitation.

In every recorded encounter they defected every round. That strongly suggests Opponent_137 is an unconditional defector (AllD) or at least extremely non-cooperative.

Match length: there's a 75% chance the match ends after each round (only 25% chance to continue). That makes the interaction effectively almost one-shot (expected rounds ≈ 1.33), so the incentive to “invest” by cooperating early to build mutual cooperation in later rounds is very weak.

Payoff considerations: against an AllD opponent, cooperating gives 0 the first round while defecting gives 1 (and continuing cooperation is unlikely because the opponent has historically always defected). With the short expected horizon and strong evidence of persistent defection, the dominant safe action is to defect.

Decision: D","History shows Opponent_135 always defected in every past encounter with me (matches 440: (D,D),(D,D); 451: (D,D); 463: (D,D),(D,D)). They never cooperated and gave no sign of conditionality or forgiveness — consistent with an All-D strategy.

With the game’s large per-round end probability (75% chance of ending each round, so only a 25% continuation probability), the shadow of the future is small, and there’s little prospect of inducing cooperation. Against a pure defector, cooperating now yields 0 immediately (they’d exploit me for 5), while defecting yields 1 now and in subsequent rounds (mutual defection). Therefore the payoff-maximizing response is to defect.

Given the payoffs (C vs D gives me 0, D vs D gives me 1) and the very high chance the game will end after any round (75% chance to end, so low continuation probability), there is little prospect of building future cooperation even if I try a one-off cooperative signal. Against an opponent who defects, defection strictly dominates cooperation (1 point vs 0).

Therefore the rational choice to maximize my expected total score is to defect.

D","Game state
- Very short expected match length: 75% chance the game ends after each round → continuation prob 0.25, so expected rounds ≈ 1.33. This makes the interaction close to a one-shot game: the incentive to defect is high because future punishment/coaxing is unlikely.

Opponent's past behavior
- We’ve met Opponent_135 several times. Their moves across those matches:
  - Match 440: (D,D), (D,D) — opponent defected both rounds
  - Match 451: (D,D) — opponent defected
  - Match 463: (D,D), (D,D) — opponent defected both rounds
  - Match 465: (D,C) — opponent cooperated while we defected
- Summary: overwhelmingly defective behavior with one isolated C. No evidence they reciprocate cooperation (we have no past episode of mutual C with them).

Strategic assessment
- Against an apparent defector, cooperating risks 0 points (if they defect) vs defecting yields 1 point (if they defect). With the short horizon, gaining a short-term 5 when they occasionally C is also possible by defecting.
- Given opponent’s near-constant defection and low continuation probability (so little chance to build cooperation later), the payoff-maximizing, robust action is to defect.

In every recorded round the opponent played D and I also played D. There is no instance of them cooperating.

Inferred strategy: opponent appears to be AllD (or at least strongly biased to defect every round). With the continuation probability very low (only 25% chance to continue each round, expected rounds ≈ 1.33), the shadow of the future is weak and there is little chance to build reciprocity.

Payoff calculus: against a persistent defector, C gives 0 while D gives 1 this round. Future gains from attempting to switch to cooperation are unlikely given the opponent’s past behavior and the short expected match length.

Decision: defect (D).

D","Opponent_135's past behavior with me is overwhelmingly defecting. Across five recent matches they played 7 rounds total: six defections and only one cooperation (the lone C occurred even though I had defected, so it looks like noise or a sporadic/cooperative error rather than a reciprocating strategy).

With the match termination probability so high (75% chance of ending after each round), there is little scope for long-run reciprocity to reward initial cooperation. Given an opponent who almost always defects, the myopic expected payoff is maximized by defecting (I get 5 when they mistakenly cooperate and 1 when they defect, vs 0 or 3 if I cooperate).

- No moves yet in the current match.
- Past encounters with this opponent: two short matches (Match 450 and Match 461). In both, the opponent played C on the round we saw (we played D both times and received the 5-point sucker payoff advantage).

Opponent model
- The opponent has shown C on their first (and only observed) move in both previous meetings — consistent with an initial-cooperate policy (could be an unconditional cooperator or a strategy that begins with C like TFT or Nice).
- Even if the opponent retaliates after being exploited, matches are very short: there is a 75% chance the game ends after each round (continuation probability = 0.25). Expected match length ≈ 1.33 rounds, so future retaliation has small weight.

Decision reasoning
- With high termination probability the game is nearly one-shot, so the dominant action for immediate expected payoff is to defect: if opponent cooperates on the first move (as observed), D yields 5 instead of 3 for C. The small chance of further rounds doesn’t justify forgoing the immediate higher payoff from defection.
- If the opponent were a long-run cooperating partner, cooperating could build future gains — but here the low continuation probability and prior evidence of first-move C make exploitation the better expected-value play.

My move:
D","Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending after each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

My past match history shows a mixed bag of opponents. Many cooperated initially (indicated by `(C,C)` in the first round), but a significant number defected when I cooperated (`(C,D)`). Some even continued to defect after I retaliated with a defection (`(D,D)`). A few opponents have shown a tit-for-tat like response, defecting after I defected (`(D,C)` after `(C,D)`). Some opponents have been consistently cooperative.

Without any prior information about this specific opponent, a good starting strategy is to be cautiously optimistic. I will start with cooperation and observe their response. This allows me to identify if they are a cooperative type, a defector, or a tit-for-tat player. If they cooperate in the first round, I will likely continue to cooperate as long as they do. If they defect, I will have to adjust my strategy based on whether they continue to defect or switch to a tit-for-tat strategy. Given the high probability of the game ending, the first few moves are crucial.

Continuation probability is 0.75 (expected ~4 rounds), so the match is likely to continue enough that exploitation can pay off.

Opponent model: in the two previous encounters (Matches 450 and 461) the opponent also played C while we played D, i.e. they did not retaliate after being defected against. That strongly suggests they are a naive cooperator or a forgiving/unchanging cooperator rather than a strict retaliator (e.g. not classic TFT). Data is limited but consistent: they appear to keep cooperating even when exploited.

Decision reasoning: if the opponent is an unconditional cooperator, repeating D each round yields 5 points per round vs 3 for mutual cooperation — strictly better for us. If the opponent were a retaliatory strategy, continuing to defect risks switching to mutual D and losing future payoff, but past encounters give no sign of punishment. Given the observed behavior and the favorable immediate payoff from exploitation, the best expected-gain move is to defect again.

D","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. My goal is to maximize my score, given a 75% chance of the game ending after each round.

My opponent is unknown, but I can look at my match history to formulate a general strategy. A large number of my initial moves have been met with cooperation. However, there are also a significant number of opponents who defected on the first round. After being burned a few times in the early rounds, many of my later opponents have also defected. This suggests the presence of some Tit-for-Tat players or those who are quick to defect. Some opponents have also shown a tendency to cooperate after I defect.

In the current match, the history is `[(C, D)]`. This means I cooperated, and my opponent defected. Given that only one round has been played, there's not much to infer about the opponent's overall strategy beyond the fact that they are willing to defect at least once.

Considering the high probability of the game ending after each round (75%), and the fact that my opponent defected on the first round, I need to prioritize maximizing my score in the short term. If I cooperate again, and they defect again, I'll get 0 points, and they'll get 5. If I defect, and they cooperate (unlikely), I'll get 5 and they'll get 0. If I defect and they defect, we'll both get 1. Given the single data point and the high termination probability, defecting is the more rational choice.

Historically with this opponent I previously saw them play C when I played D in earlier short matches, but in this current match they retaliated on round 2.

Opponent model: their pattern (start C, then D after I defected) is consistent with Tit‑for‑Tat (start C, then mirror) or a Grim/retaliatory strategy (cooperate until I defect, then defect thereafter). Either model implies they will play D this round (they mirror my last D or continue to punish).

Horizon/ incentives: the game has a 75% chance of ending after each round (only 25% continuation), so the shadow of the future is weak. With the opponent very likely to defect this round, the only safe payoff is to defect: D/D gives me 1, while C against their D would give me 0. Attempting to re-establish cooperation (by playing C now) risks a sucker payoff with little expected future benefit because continuation is unlikely.

Decision: defect is the dominant prudent action given the opponent’s apparent retaliation and the short expected remaining interaction.

D","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. My goal is to maximize my score over multiple rounds, but there's a 75% chance the game ends after each round.

My past history shows a mix of opponents. Many initially cooperated (I cooperated first in all but a few matches), but a significant number defected early. Some even continued to defect after I defected in response. A few have shown tit-for-tat behavior.

In this current match, the history is:
1. (C, D) - I cooperated, the opponent defected.
2. (D, D) - I defected, the opponent defected.

The opponent has shown they will defect even after I defected. This suggests they are not playing tit-for-tat, and they might be a consistent defector. Given the high probability of the game ending, trying to establish cooperation might not be worth the risk. The opponent has already shown they are willing to defect when I cooperate.

Therefore, I will defect again.

Game-theoretic reasoning: when the opponent always defects, my best response each round is to defect (D yields 1 point vs 0 for C). Given the high continuation probability (expected ~4 rounds), there is some long-run benefit from mutual cooperation only if the opponent would reciprocate — but past data shows no reciprocity, so attempting to cooperate only hands them 5 points while I get 0.

Implications for payoffs: against a defector, cooperating gives 0 while defecting gives 1 (both-defect = 1 each). There's no prospect of building mutual cooperation given their history, and the high 75% chance of termination after each round further reduces any long-run incentive to try risky cooperation.

- If the opponent will defect this round, my payoffs are: D→1 (mutual defection) vs C→0 (I get exploited). Defection strictly dominates cooperation against a defector.
- The continuation probability is low (only 25% chance the game continues each round), so attempts to build cooperation have little expected future payoff and are unlikely given the opponent’s track record.

- That strongly indicates an All-Defect strategy (or at least a reliably defecting policy with negligible cooperation).
- The game has a 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability = 0.25), so the future is heavily discounted; expected future rounds are few. That reduces the value of trying to build cooperation or tolerate short-term losses for long-term gain.

- Given the opponent reliably defects, cooperating would give me 0 points (they defect) while defecting guarantees at least 1 point (mutual defection). With continuation unlikely, the potential future gains from attempting to induce cooperation are minimal.

Strategic reasoning: Against an AllD opponent, cooperating yields 0 while defecting yields 1 each round, so defect strictly dominates.

Interpretation of opponent strategy:
- The pattern is consistent with Tit-for-Tat (or a TFT-like strategy): first move C, then copy my previous move. In single-round matches they show the initial C; in a multi-round match they switched to D immediately after I defected.

Game-state and payoff reasoning (continuation math):
- The match continues after each round with probability δ = 0.25 (since there is a 75% chance of ending each round).
- If I cooperate now (play C): opponent plays C (first move), giving 3 this round and likely continued mutual cooperation thereafter. Expected total = 3 / (1 − δ) = 3 / 0.75 = 4.
- If I defect now (play D): I get 5 this round. Against TFT they will retaliate next round, leading to mutual D thereafter (1 per subsequent round). Expected total = 5 + δ * (1 / (1 − δ)) = 5 + 0.25/0.75 = 5 + 0.333... = 5.333...

Conclusion:
- Given the strong evidence opponent is TFT and the low continuation probability, defecting this first move yields a higher expected total payoff.

D","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma. My goal is to maximize my score over many rounds, but each round has a 75% chance of ending.

My past history shows a mixed bag of opponents.  A significant number of opponents cooperated at least once (indicated by `(C,C)` or `(C,D)` in the first round). Some opponents retaliated after being defected on (`(C,D), (D,C)`). A few opponents consistently defected, even after I initially cooperated. Some started with cooperation and then defected when I cooperated.

Given that I have no information about the current opponent, a reasonable starting strategy is to cooperate. This allows for the possibility of establishing a mutually beneficial cooperative relationship. If the opponent defects, I can then consider switching to a more aggressive strategy like Tit-for-Tat (retaliate immediately). However, given the high probability of the game ending after each round (75%), a single defection from their side might not be enough to warrant switching to full defection, as there might not be enough rounds left for retaliation to pay off.

Therefore, my initial move is to cooperate, hoping to signal a willingness to cooperate and see how the opponent responds.

- That pattern strongly indicates Opponent_137 is an All-D or near‑always‑defect strategy (never observed cooperating).
- Payoff consequences: against a defector, C yields 0 while D yields 1 each round. With a high 75% chance the match ends after any round (continuation prob = 25%), there is little future value to try to “teach” cooperation — the expected remaining rounds are small, so short‑term gain from defecting dominates.

- Only one round has been played so far: (D, D).
- The match is likely to end soon (75% chance of ending after each round), so there are few expected future rounds.

Opponent's strategy (inferred)
- In four previous matches with this same opponent (and many other matches overall) the opponent consistently played D every round. Their past records vs me: mostly (D,D) or sequences where they defected every time.
- Given that strong and repeated evidence, the best model is that Opponent_139 is an unconditional defector (All-D) or at least extremely persistent at defecting.

Decision reasoning
- If the opponent keeps defecting, cooperating now would give me 0 points this round (while D gives 1), and with high termination probability there is little chance to build future reciprocal cooperation.
- Against an All-D opponent the myopically and long-run optimal play is to defect every round to avoid being exploited and to maximize expected total payoff given few remaining rounds.

My move
D","Game state: We've just played one round in this match and it was (D,D). With a 75% chance the game will end after each round, there is a high probability this match has at most one or two additional rounds (expected total rounds ≈1.33), so future opportunities to build cooperation are very limited.

Opponent history summary: In five prior encounters with Opponent_137 the opponent never cooperated toward me — the records are almost exclusively D (many matches with (D,D) rounds and one match where they defected while I cooperated (C,D)). That pattern strongly indicates an All‑Defect or near‑always‑defect strategy.

Decision reasoning: Given the opponent’s consistent defection and the short expected remaining horizon, cooperating now risks getting 0 (if they defect) while defecting guarantees at least the mutual‑defect payoff (1). There is minimal reason to attempt a costly signal of cooperation when past data shows no reciprocation and the game likely ends soon.

Looking at prior encounters with Opponent_139 (multiple matches recorded: Match 448, 459, 468, 475) they have always defected from the start — every recorded result against them is mutual defection. That strongly indicates an AllD (always defect) or at least an uncompromising defect-first policy.

Implications: The continuation probability is very low (only 25% chance to continue each round), so expected remaining rounds are small. With an opponent who defects unconditionally, any cooperation now would be exploited (0 points for me vs 5 for them) and would not reliably induce future cooperation given their past behavior. By defecting I secure 1 point this round (vs 0 if I unilaterally cooperate) and I avoid being exploited in the few expected remaining rounds.

Decision: Opponent appears to be AllD; no credible prospect of mutually profitable cooperation. Defecting maximizes my expected payoff.

D","Opponent's past behavior (multiple previous matches) shows near-certainty of defection: our encounters with Opponent_137 have almost always ended in mutual defection (many (D,D) entries) and once they defected while we cooperated (C,D). In the current match they've defected in both rounds so far: (D,D), (D,D). That strongly indicates an AllD or mostly-defecting strategy.

The continuation probability is only 25% each round (75% chance the game ends), so the shadow of the future is weak — it's hard to credibly sustain cooperation. Given the strong evidence the opponent will defect next round, my immediate best response is to defect: cooperating against a defector yields 0 now vs 1 if I also defect, and the low continuation probability makes attempted forgiveness or testing cooperation unlikely to pay off.

Decision: D

- Current match has had 3 rounds, all (D,D).
- Opponent_139's past matches with me (Matches 448, 459, 468, 475) were all mutual defection outcomes: every recorded interaction is D by them (often repeated D,D sequences).

What this indicates about the opponent
- Strong evidence Opponent_139 is an always-defect or very unforgiving defector (persistent D in every encounter).
- They have not responded to cooperation attempts in past history; there is no sign they will switch to C if I try to cooperate.

Strategic reasoning
- Payoffs: mutual C = 3, mutual D = 1, being exploited (C vs D) = 0 for me, exploiting (D vs C) = 5 for me.
- Given the opponent's consistent defecting, cooperating now risks giving 0 this round (if they continue to defect) with little prospect of establishing sustained cooperation.
- The game has only a 25% chance to continue after each round (75% chance of ending). With such a high termination probability, the value of trying to build cooperation in future rounds is low; expected future gains from attempting to convert them to cooperation are small.
- Against an apparent always-defector, defection is the safe, payoff-maximizing response: it prevents exploitation (0) and guarantees at least 1 point per round instead of risking 0.

Decision
- I will defect.

D","Game state summary
- Current match: three rounds, all (D,D). No sign of the opponent reciprocating cooperation so far.
- Historical evidence vs Opponent_137: in prior meetings they almost always defected. Examples: Match 444 [(D,D),(D,D)], Match 455 [(D,D)], Match 471 [(D,D)], Match 479 [(D,D)], and the one non-mutual case was Match 464 [(C,D)] — i.e. they defected while I cooperated. Overall their past behavior is consistent with a persistent defector.

Opponent strategy inference
- Best explanation of the data is that Opponent_137 is a fixed defector (or at least highly biased to defect and unresponsive to attempts to cooperate).
- There is no reliable evidence they will switch to cooperation in response to my cooperation.

Strategic decision
- Payoffs: mutual D = 1, mutual C = 3, unilateral C yields 0 while the other gets 5.
- Continuation probability is only 0.25, so future rewards from trying to induce cooperation are heavily discounted; with an opponent that appears to always defect, the short horizon makes trying to “train” them unattractive.
- Against a pure or near-pure defector, the myopically optimal action is D (it yields 1 instead of 0 if I unilaterally cooperate). Given the opponent’s history, the risk of being exploited is high and the expected benefit of switching to C is negligible.

- Match 450: (D, C)
- Match 461: (D, C)
- Match 470: (D, C), (D, D), (D, D)
- Match 477: (D, C)

What this suggests about the opponent
- They consistently play C on the first round of a match.
- In the multi-round match (470) they switched to D after being defected on, consistent with Tit‑for‑Tat or some form of conditional cooperator (cooperate first, then retaliate when exploited). They are not a pure Always‑Cooperate (they retaliate at least within a match).

Game‑theoretic reasoning
- The match continuation probability is high (p = 0.75), so long mutual cooperation yields a much higher expected payoff than a one‑shot exploitation. If the opponent is TFT-like, cooperating from the start gives mutual C every round: expected rounds = 1/(1−p) = 4, so expected payoff ≈ 3*4 = 12.
- If I defect first against a TFT opponent, I get 5 in round 1 but will be punished with mutual defection thereafter: expected payoff ≈ 5 + 1*(expected remaining rounds) = 5 + 3 = 8, which is worse than cooperating.
- Empirical data (they defect after being exploited within a match) supports treating them as conditional cooperator; therefore initiating cooperation maximizes my expected total score.

Decision
Start cooperatively to achieve sustained mutual cooperation.

C","Okay, let's analyze the situation.

I've played a lot of Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma rounds. My general strategy has been to start with cooperation (C) and then adapt based on the opponent's behavior. I've encountered a wide range of opponents, from those who consistently cooperate to those who consistently defect, and some who switch between the two.

In this particular match, I have no information about the opponent yet. Since I have no history with this specific opponent, and my initial strategy has been to cooperate, I will start with cooperation. This allows me to see how the opponent responds and adjust my strategy accordingly in later rounds. It's important to build trust early on, as mutual cooperation yields the highest average payoff in the long run, given the 75% chance of the game ending each round.

History vs this opponent: we've met several times (Matches 448, 459, 468, 475, 480). In every recorded round across those matches the opponent played D; most encounters are sequences of mutual defection (no evidence of cooperation from them).

Inference about opponent: the opponent behaves like an All-D (always-defect) strategy or extremely nearly so — very low probability they will cooperate spontaneously given the consistent past behavior.

Game-theoretic reasoning:
- If the opponent is All-D, best response each round is D (payoff 1) rather than C (payoff 0).
- Mutual cooperation (3 each) is attractive only if the opponent is willing to cooperate; history gives no reason to expect that.
- The match has a 75% chance of ending after each round (continuation probability 0.25), so the shadow of the future is weak — it's hard to credibly sustain cooperation even if we tried to ""punish/forgive"" to induce it.

Decision: play defect (D).

D","Game state and length
- Each round has a 75% chance the match ends; continuation probability = 0.25, so expected match length is short (~1.33 rounds). This heavily weights the immediate next move.

Opponent's past behavior (Opponent_138)
- All recorded encounters with Opponent_138 (matches 446, 457, 466, 473, 478) show only mutual defection outcomes: every round observed was (D,D). There are no instances of the opponent cooperating in the history.
- That pattern strongly indicates a persistent defecting strategy (AllD or near-AllD).

Implications for strategy
- Against an opponent who defects consistently, cooperating can only hurt me: C vs D gives me 0 instead of 1 if I defect.
- The short expected match length reduces any benefit from attempts to build cooperation (there’s little chance to reciprocate).
- The payoff-maximizing myopic choice against a reliable defector is to defect as well (secure 1 point instead of risking 0).

Decision
- Play D

Based on my match history, I've encountered a wide range of opponents. A significant number of them initially cooperated (chose 'C'), but many switched to defecting ('D') after I initially cooperated. Some opponents seem to be Tit-for-Tat players, while others are more exploitative, always defecting after an initial cooperation. A few are consistently cooperative.

Since this is the first round of the current match, I have no information about this specific opponent. Given the high probability of the game ending after each round (75%), a purely exploitative strategy of always defecting is risky, as it might lead to a low score if the game ends quickly. However, starting with cooperation and then adapting based on the opponent's response seems like a more robust approach.

Therefore, I will start by cooperating and observe the opponent's response. This allows me to gather information about their strategy and adjust my subsequent moves accordingly.

- Continuation probability is only 25% (75% chance the match ends after any round), so the expected number of rounds is very small — roughly 1.33 rounds. That makes the future punishment/reward relatively weak compared with the immediate payoff.
- In a one-shot PD the dominant action is to defect; with a very short expected horizon that logic strongly dominates.

What the opponent seems to do
- In our six prior encounters with Opponent_140 (Matches 450, 461, 470, 477, 482, 485) the opponent cooperated far more often than they defected. Across 8 rounds: C,C,C,D,D,C,C,C — about 75% cooperation.
- They have defected in a few later rounds (notably in the 3-round match), suggesting they can retaliate or switch to D if circumstances push them, but overall they appear to be a mostly-cooperative or naive-cooperative type rather than an unforgiving Grim-style defector.

Decision reasoning
- Given the opponent’s high cooperation rate, defecting on the first move gives a high immediate payoff (5 vs 3) and the chance the game ends is large, so the risk of long-term retaliation is small.
- Even if the opponent sometimes retaliates in later rounds, the low continuation probability and our observed evidence that they often keep cooperating after some defections make first-round defection the best expected-score play.

My move:
D","Okay, let's analyze the situation. I'm playing the Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a 75% chance of the game ending each round. My goal is to maximize my score.

My past match history shows a mixed bag of opponents. A significant number of opponents initially cooperated (C), but many eventually defected (D) after I initially cooperated. Some even started with defection. A few have shown patterns of alternating or repeated defection.

The current match has no history yet. Given the high probability of the game ending early (75% each round), a purely tit-for-tat strategy might be too slow to capitalize on cooperation. However, immediately defecting carries the risk of missing out on potential mutual cooperation, especially against opponents who are predisposed to cooperate.

Based on the historical data, a large portion of opponents initially cooperate. Therefore, I will start with a cooperative move. If the opponent defects, I will likely defect in the subsequent round.

**Opponent Analysis:**

Based on the history, this opponent (which I don't have a name for) defected on the first move after I cooperated. This strongly suggests they are employing a strategy that tends toward defection. They could be:

*   **Always Defect:** They will always defect regardless of my moves.
*   **Tit-for-Tat with a Defect Bias:** They start by cooperating, but if I defect, they defect for a while, or they defect more often than they cooperate.
*   **Grim Trigger:** Cooperate until I defect, then defect forever.
*   **Random:** They randomly choose C or D.

**Game State Analysis:**

We are in the second round of the game. Since the first round resulted in (C, D), I received 0 points, and the opponent received 5 points. The probability of the game continuing is 75%.

**Strategic Considerations:**

Given that the opponent defected on the first round, I need to consider my options carefully.

*   **Cooperate (C):** If I cooperate again, I risk getting 0 points again if they defect. However, there's a chance they might cooperate this round, leading to 3 points each.
*   **Defect (D):** If I defect, I'll get 1 point if they also defect, and 5 points if they cooperate.

Since the opponent defected immediately, and the probability of the game ending each round is 75%, I should try to exploit their likely defection. If they are playing a strategy like ""Always Defect"", then I should defect as well. If they are playing Tit-for-Tat, then I should defect to punish them for their initial defection.

**Decision:**

I will defect this round.
